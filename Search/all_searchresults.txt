AB  - Free gaze and moving images are typically avoided in EEG experiments due to the 
      expected generation of artifacts and noise. Yet for a growing number of research 
      questions, loosening these rigorous restrictions would be beneficial. Among these 
      is research on visual aesthetic experiences, which often involve open-ended 
      exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we systematically compare the effect 
      of conservative vs. more liberal experimental settings on various measures of 
      behavior, brain activity and physiology in an aesthetic rating task. Our primary 
      aim was to assess EEG signal quality. 43 participants either maintained fixation 
      or were allowed to gaze freely, and viewed either static images or dynamic 
      (video) stimuli consisting of dance performances or nature scenes. A passive 
      auditory background task (auditory steady-state response; ASSR) was added as a 
      proxy measure for overall EEG recording quality. We recorded EEG, ECG and eye 
      tracking data, and participants rated their aesthetic preference and state of 
      boredom on each trial. Whereas both behavioral ratings and gaze behavior were 
      affected by task and stimulus manipulations, EEG SNR was barely affected and 
      generally robust across all conditions, despite only minimal preprocessing and no 
      trial rejection. In particular, we show that using video stimuli does not 
      necessarily result in lower EEG quality and can, on the contrary, significantly 
      reduce eye movements while increasing both the participants' aesthetic response 
      and general task engagement. We see these as encouraging results indicating that 
      - at least in the lab - more liberal experimental conditions can be adopted 
      without significant loss of signal quality.

TI  - Zapline-plus: A Zapline extension for automatic and adaptive removal of 
      frequency-specific noise artifacts in M/EEG.
PG  - 2743-2758
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25832 [doi]
AB  - Removing power line noise and other frequency-specific artifacts from 
      electrophysiological data without affecting neural signals remains a challenging 
      task. Recently, an approach was introduced that combines spectral and spatial 
      filtering to effectively remove line noise: Zapline. This algorithm, however, 
      requires manual selection of the noise frequency and the number of spatial 
      components to remove during spatial filtering. Moreover, it assumes that noise 
      frequency and spatial topography are stable over time, which is often not 
      warranted. To overcome these issues, we introduce Zapline-plus, which allows 
      adaptive and automatic removal of frequency-specific noise artifacts from 
      M/electroencephalography (EEG) and LFP data. To achieve this, our extension first 
      segments the data into periods (chunks) in which the noise is spatially stable. 
      Then, for each chunk, it searches for peaks in the power spectrum, and finally 
      applies Zapline. The exact noise frequency around the found target frequency is 
      also determined separately for every chunk to allow fluctuations of the peak 
      noise frequency over time. The number of to-be-removed components by Zapline is 
      automatically determined using an outlier detection algorithm. Finally, the 
      frequency spectrum after cleaning is analyzed for suboptimal cleaning, and 
      parameters are adapted accordingly if necessary before re-running the process. 
      The software creates a detailed plot for monitoring the cleaning. We highlight 
      the efficacy of the different features of our algorithm by applying it to four 
      openly available data sets, two EEG sets containing both stationary and mobile 
      task conditions, and two magnetoencephalography sets containing strong line 
      noise.

AB  - Early detection is critical to control Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and 
      postpone cognitive decline. Traditional medical procedures such as magnetic 
      resonance imaging are costly, involve long waiting lists, and require complex 
      analysis. Alternatively, for the past years, researchers have successfully 
      evaluated AD detection approaches based on machine learning and 
      electroencephalography (EEG). Nonetheless, these approaches frequently rely upon 
      manual processing or involve non-portable EEG hardware. These aspects are 
      suboptimal regarding automated diagnosis, since they require additional personnel 
      and hinder portability. In this work, we report the preliminary evaluation of a 
      self-driven AD multi-class discrimination approach based on a commercial EEG 
      acquisition system using sixteen channels. For this purpose, we recorded the EEG 
      of three groups of participants: mild AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) non-AD, 
      and controls, and we implemented a self-driven analysis pipeline to discriminate 
      the three groups. First, we applied automated artifact rejection algorithms to 
      the EEG recordings. Then, we extracted power, entropy, and complexity features 
      from the preprocessed epochs. Finally, we evaluated a multi-class classification 
      problem using a multi-layer perceptron through leave-one-subject-out 
      cross-validation. The preliminary results that we obtained are comparable to the 
      best in literature (0.88 F1-score), what suggests that AD can potentially be 
      detected through a self-driven approach based on commercial EEG and machine 
      learning. We believe this work and further research could contribute to opening 
      the door for the detection of AD in a single consultation session, therefore 
      reducing the costs associated to AD screening and potentially advancing medical 
      treatment.

AB  - The use of electroencephalography (EEG) has recently grown as a means to diagnose 
      neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD recognition 
      can benefit from machine learning methods that, compared with traditional manual 
      diagnosis methods, have higher reliability and improved recognition accuracy, 
      being able to manage large amounts of data. Nevertheless, machine learning 
      methods may exhibit lower accuracies when faced with incomplete, corrupted, or 
      otherwise missing data, so it is important do develop robust pre-processing 
      techniques do deal with incomplete data. The aim of this paper is to develop an 
      automatic classification method that can still work well with EEG data affected 
      by artifacts, as can arise during the collection with, e.g., a wireless system 
      that can lose packets. We show that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can operate 
      successfully even in the case of significantly corrupted data, when it is 
      pre-filtered by the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) algorithm. RPCA 
      was selected because of its stated ability to remove outliers from the signal. To 
      demonstrate this idea, we first develop an RNN which operates on EEG data, 
      properly processed through traditional PCA; then, we use corrupted data as input 
      and process them with RPCA to filter outlier components, showing that even with 
      data corruption causing up to 20% erasures, the RPCA was able to increase the 
      detection accuracy by about 5% with respect to the baseline PCA.

AB  - Neurocritical patients suffer from a substantial risk of extubation failure. The 
      aim of this prospective study was to analyze if quantitative EEG (qEEG) 
      monitoring is able to predict successful extubation in these patients. We 
      analyzed EEG-monitoring for at least six hours before extubation in patients 
      receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) on our neurological intensive care unit 
      (NICU) between November 2017 and May 2019. Patients were divided in 2 groups: 
      patients with successful extubation (SE) versus patients with complications after 
      MV withdrawal (failed extubation; FE), including reintubation, need for 
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or death. Bipolar six channel EEG was applied. 
      Unselected raw EEG signal underwent automated artefact rejection and Short Time 
      Fast Fourier Transformation. The following relative proportions of global EEG 
      spectrum were analyzed: relative beta (RB), alpha (RA), theta (RT), delta (RD) as 
      well as the alpha delta ratio (ADR). Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated 
      as a measure of fluctuations in the different power bands. Mann-Whitney U test 
      and logistic regression were applied to analyze group differences. 52 patients 
      were included (26 male, mean age 65 ± 17 years, diagnosis: 40% seizures/status 
      epilepticus, 37% ischemia, 13% intracranial hemorrhage, 10% others). Successful 
      extubation was possible in 40 patients (77%), reintubation was necessary in 6 
      patients (12%), 5 patients (10%) required NIV, one patient died. In contrast to 
      FE patients, SE patients showed more stable EEG power values (lower CV) 
      considering all EEG channels (RB: p < 0.0005; RA: p = 0.045; RT: p = 0.045) with 
      RB as an independent predictor of weaning success in logistic regression 
      (p = 0.004). The proportion of the EEG frequency bands (RB, RA RT, RD) of the 
      entire EEG power spectrum was not significantly different between SE and FE 
      patients. Higher fluctuations in qEEG frequency bands, reflecting greater 
      fluctuation in alertness, during the hours before cessation of MV were associated 
      with a higher rate of complications after extubation in this cohort. The 
      stability of qEEG power values may represent a non-invasive, examiner-independent 
      parameter to facilitate weaning assessment in neurocritical patients.

TI  - EEG-TNet: An End-To-End Brain Computer Interface Framework for Mental Workload 
      Estimation.
PG  - 869522

AB  - The mental workload (MWL) of different occupational groups' workers is the main 
      and direct factor of unsafe behavior, which may cause serious accidents. One of 
      the new and useful technologies to estimate MWL is the Brain computer interface 
      (BCI) based on EEG signals, which is regarded as the gold standard of cognitive 
      status. However, estimation systems involving handcrafted EEG features are 
      time-consuming and unsuitable to apply in real-time. The purpose of this study 
      was to propose an end-to-end BCI framework for MWL estimation. First, a new 
      automated data preprocessing method was proposed to remove the artifact without 
      human interference. Then a new neural network structure named EEG-TNet was 
      designed to extract both the temporal and frequency information from the original 
      EEG. Furthermore, two types of experiments and ablation studies were performed to 
      prove the effectiveness of this model. In the subject-dependent experiment, the 
      estimation accuracy of dual-task estimation (No task vs. TASK) and triple-task 
      estimation (Lo vs. Mi vs. Hi) reached 99.82 and 99.21%, respectively. In 
      contrast, the accuracy of different tasks reached 82.78 and 66.83% in 
      subject-independent experiments. Additionally, the ablation studies proved that 
      preprocessing method and network structure had significant contributions to 
      estimation MWL. The proposed method is convenient without any human intervention 
      and outperforms other related studies, which becomes an effective way to reduce 
      human factor risks.

TI  - Emotion Recognition Using a Reduced Set of EEG Channels Based on Holographic 
      Feature Maps.
LID - 10.3390/s22093248 [doi]
LID - 3248
AB  - An important function of the construction of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) 
      device is the development of a model that is able to recognize emotions from 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Research in this area is very challenging 
      because the EEG signal is non-stationary, non-linear, and contains a lot of noise 
      due to artifacts caused by muscle activity and poor electrode contact. EEG 
      signals are recorded with non-invasive wearable devices using a large number of 
      electrodes, which increase the dimensionality and, thereby, also the 
      computational complexity of EEG data. It also reduces the level of comfort of the 
      subjects. This paper implements our holographic features, investigates electrode 
      selection, and uses the most relevant channels to maximize model accuracy. The 
      ReliefF and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) methods were used to select the 
      optimal electrodes. Verification was performed on four publicly available 
      datasets. Our holographic feature maps were constructed using computer-generated 
      holography (CGH) based on the values of signal characteristics displayed in 
      space. The resulting 2D maps are the input to the Convolutional Neural Network 
      (CNN), which serves as a feature extraction method. This methodology uses a 
      reduced set of electrodes, which are different between men and women, and obtains 
      state-of-the-art results in a three-dimensional emotional space. The experimental 
      results show that the channel selection methods improve emotion recognition rates 
      significantly with an accuracy of 90.76% for valence, 92.92% for arousal, and 
      92.97% for dominance.

TI  - Motion Artifacts Correction from Single-Channel EEG and fNIRS Signals Using Novel 
      Wavelet Packet Decomposition in Combination with Canonical Correlation Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/s22093169 [doi]
LID - 3169
AB  - The electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
      signals, highly non-stationary in nature, greatly suffers from motion artifacts 
      while recorded using wearable sensors. Since successful detection of various 
      neurological and neuromuscular disorders is greatly dependent upon clean EEG and 
      fNIRS signals, it is a matter of utmost importance to remove/reduce motion 
      artifacts from EEG and fNIRS signals using reliable and robust methods. In this 
      regard, this paper proposes two robust methods: (i) Wavelet packet decomposition 
      (WPD) and (ii) WPD in combination with canonical correlation analysis (WPD-CCA), 
      for motion artifact correction from single-channel EEG and fNIRS signals. The 
      efficacy of these proposed techniques is tested using a benchmark dataset and the 
      performance of the proposed methods is measured using two well-established 
      performance matrices: (i) difference in the signal to noise ratio ( ) and (ii) 
      percentage reduction in motion artifacts ( ). The proposed WPD-based single-stage 
      motion artifacts correction technique produces the highest average 
      &amp;nbsp;(29.44 dB) when db2 wavelet packet is incorporated whereas the greatest 
      average &amp;nbsp;(53.48%) is obtained using db1 wavelet packet for all the 
      available 23 EEG recordings. Our proposed two-stage motion artifacts correction 
      technique, i.e., the WPD-CCA method utilizing db1 wavelet packet has shown the 
      best denoising performance producing an average &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;values of 
      30.76 dB and 59.51%, respectively, for all the EEG recordings. On the other hand, 
      for the available 16 fNIRS recordings, the two-stage motion artifacts removal 
      technique, i.e., WPD-CCA has produced the best average &amp;nbsp;(16.55 dB, 
      utilizing db1 wavelet packet) and largest average &amp;nbsp;(41.40%, using fk8 
      wavelet packet). The highest average &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;using single-stage 
      artifacts removal techniques (WPD) are found as 16.11 dB and 26.40%, 
      respectively, for all the fNIRS signals using fk4 wavelet packet. In both EEG and 
      fNIRS modalities, the percentage reduction in motion artifacts increases by 
      11.28% and 56.82%, respectively when two-stage WPD-CCA techniques are employed in 
      comparison with the single-stage WPD method. In addition, the average 
      &amp;nbsp;also increases when WPD-CCA techniques are used instead of single-stage 
      WPD for both EEG and fNIRS signals. The increment in both &amp;nbsp;and 
      &amp;nbsp;values is a clear indication that two-stage WPD-CCA performs relatively 
      better compared to single-stage WPD. The results reported using the proposed 
      methods outperform most of the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

TI  - Parkinson's Disease Detection from Resting-State EEG Signals Using Common Spatial 
      Pattern, Entropy, and Machine Learning Techniques.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12051033 [doi]
LID - 1033
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a very common brain abnormality that affects people 
      all over the world. Early detection of such abnormality is critical in clinical 
      diagnosis in order to prevent disease progression. Electroencephalography (EEG) 
      is one of the most important PD diagnostic tools since this disease is linked to 
      the brain. In this study, novel efficient common spatial pattern-based approaches 
      for detecting Parkinson's disease in two cases, off-medication and on-medication, 
      are proposed. First, the EEG signals are preprocessed to remove major artifacts 
      before spatial filtering using a common spatial pattern. Several features are 
      extracted from spatially filtered signals using different metrics, namely, 
      variance, band power, energy, and several types of entropy. Machine learning 
      techniques, namely, random forest, linear/quadratic discriminant analysis, 
      support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, are investigated to classify the 
      extracted features. The impacts of frequency bands, segment length, and reduction 
      number on the results are also investigated in this work. The proposed methods 
      are tested using two EEG datasets: the SanDiego dataset (31 participants, 93 min) 
      and the UNM dataset (54 participants, 54 min). The results show that the proposed 
      methods, particularly the combination of common spatial patterns and log energy 
      entropy, provide competitive results when compared to methods in the literature. 
      The achieved results in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity in the case of off-medication PD detection are around 99%. In the 
      case of on-medication PD, the results range from 95% to 98%. The results also 
      reveal that features extracted from the alpha and beta bands have the highest 
      classification accuracy.

LID - 10.3390/s22083051 [doi]
LID - 3051
AB  - Vigilance level assessment is of prime importance to avoid life-threatening human 
      error. Critical working environments such as air traffic control, driving, or 
      military surveillance require the operator to be alert the whole time. The 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) is a very common modality that can be used in 
      assessing vigilance. Unfortunately, EEG signals are prone to artifacts due to eye 
      movement, muscle contraction, and electrical noise. Mitigating these artifacts is 
      important for an accurate vigilance level assessment. Independent Component 
      Analysis (ICA) is an effective method and has been extensively used in the 
      suppression of EEG artifacts. However, in vigilance assessment applications, it 
      was found to suffer from leakage of the cerebral activity into artifacts. In this 
      work, we show that the wavelet ICA (wICA) method provides an alternative for 
      artifact reduction, leading to improved vigilance level assessment results. We 
      conducted an experiment in nine human subjects to induce two vigilance states, 
      alert and vigilance decrement, while performing a Stroop Color-Word Test for 
      approximately 45 min. We then compared the performance of the ICA and wICA 
      preprocessing methods using five classifiers. Our classification results showed 
      that in terms of features extraction, the wICA method outperformed the existing 
      ICA method. In the delta, theta, and alpha bands, we obtained a mean 
      classification accuracy of 84.66% using the ICA method, whereas the mean accuracy 
      using the wICA methodwas 96.9%. However, no significant improvement was observed 
      in the beta band. In addition, we compared the topographical map to show the 
      changes in power spectral density across the brain regions for the two vigilance 
      states. The proposed method showed that the frontal and central regions were most 
      sensitive to vigilance decrement. However, in this application, the proposed wICA 
      shows a marginal improvement compared to the Fast-ICA.

TI  - Automatic Muscle Artifacts Identification and Removal from Single-Channel EEG 
      Using Wavelet Transform with Meta-Heuristically Optimized Non-Local Means Filter.
LID - 10.3390/s22082948 [doi]
LID - 2948
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals may get easily contaminated by muscle 
      artifacts, which may lead to wrong interpretation in the brain-computer interface 
      (BCI) system as well as in various medical diagnoses. The main objective of this 
      paper is to remove muscle artifacts without distorting the information contained 
      in the EEG. A novel multi-stage EEG denoising method is proposed for the first 
      time in which wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is combined with a modified 
      non-local means (NLM) algorithm. At first, the artifact EEG signal is identified 
      through a pre-trained classifier. Next, the identified EEG signal is decomposed 
      into wavelet coefficients and corrected through a modified NLM filter. Finally, 
      the artifact-free EEG is reconstructed from corrected wavelet coefficients 
      through inverse WPD. To optimize the filter parameters, two meta-heuristic 
      algorithms are used in this paper for the first time. The proposed system is 
      first validated on simulated EEG data and then tested on real EEG data. The 
      proposed approach achieved average mutual information (MI) as 2.9684 ± 0.7045 on 
      real EEG data. The result reveals that the proposed system outperforms recently 
      developed denoising techniques with higher average MI, which indicates that the 
      proposed approach is better in terms of quality of reconstruction and is fully 
      automatic.

TI  - Heart Rate Variability Analysis for Seizure Detection in Neonatal Intensive Care 
      Units.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering9040165 [doi]
LID - 165
AB  - In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), the early detection of neonatal 
      seizures is of utmost importance for a timely clinical intervention. Over the 
      years, several neonatal seizure detection systems were proposed to detect 
      neonatal seizures automatically and speed up seizure diagnosis, most based on the 
      EEG signal analysis. Recently, research has focused on other possible seizure 
      markers, such as electrocardiography (ECG). This work proposes an ECG-based NSD 
      system to investigate the usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to 
      detect neonatal seizures in the NICUs. HRV analysis is performed considering 
      time-domain, frequency-domain, entropy and multiscale entropy features. The 
      performance is evaluated on a dataset of ECG signals from 51 full-term babies, 29 
      seizure-free. The proposed system gives results comparable to those reported in 
      the literature: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve = 62%, 
      Sensitivity = 47%, Specificity = 67%. Moreover, the system's performance is 
      evaluated in a real clinical environment, inevitably affected by several 
      artefacts. To the best of our knowledge, our study proposes for the first time a 
      multi-feature ECG-based NSD system that also offers a comparative analysis 
      between babies suffering from seizures and seizure-free ones.

TI  - Optimized deformable convolution network for detection and mitigation of ocular 
      artifacts from EEG signal.
PG  - 1-39
LID - 10.1007/s11042-022-12874-4 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the key component in the field of analyzing brain 
      activity and behavior. EEG signals are affected by artifacts in the recorded 
      electrical activity; thereby it affects the analysis of EGG. To extract the clean 
      data from EEG signals and to improve the efficiency of detection during 
      encephalogram recordings, a developed model is required. Although various methods 
      have been proposed for the artifacts removal process, sill the research on this 
      process continues. Even if, several types of artifacts from both the subject and 
      equipment interferences are highly contaminated the EEG signals, the most common 
      and important type of interferences is known as Ocular artifacts. Many 
      applications like Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) need online and real-time 
      processing of EEG signals. Hence, it is best if the removal of artifacts is 
      performed in an online fashion. The main intention of this proposal is to 
      accomplish the new deep learning-based ocular artifacts detection and prevention 
      model. In the detection phase, the 5-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and 
      Pisarenko harmonic decomposition are used for decomposing the signals. Then, the 
      Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are 
      adopted as the techniques for extracting the features. With the collected 
      features, the development of optimized Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCN) is 
      used for the detection of ocular artifacts from the input EEG signal. Here, the 
      optimized DCN is developed by optimizing or tuning some significant parameters by 
      Distance Sorted-Electric Fish Optimization (DS-EFO). If the artifacts are 
      detected, the mitigation process is performed by applying the Empirical Mean 
      Curve Decomposition (EMCD), and then, the optimized DCN is used for denoising the 
      signals. Finally, the clean signal is generated by applying inverse EMCD. Based 
      on the EEG data collected from diverse subjects, the proposed method has achieved 
      a higher performance than that of conventional methods, which demonstrates a 
      better ocular-artifact reduction by the proposed method.

AB  - Stimulus-induced narrow-band gamma oscillations (20-70 Hz) are induced in the 
      visual areas of the brain when particular visual stimuli, such as bars, gratings, 
      or full-screen hue, are shown to the subject. Such oscillations are modulated by 
      higher cognitive functions, like attention, and working memory, and have been 
      shown to be abnormal in certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as 
      schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. However, although 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) remains one of the most non-invasive, inexpensive, and 
      accessible methods to record brain signals, some studies have failed to observe 
      discernable gamma oscillations in human EEG. In this manuscript, we have 
      described in detail a protocol to elicit robust gamma oscillations in human EEG. 
      We believe that our protocol could help in developing non-invasive gamma-based 
      biomarkers in human EEG, for the early detection of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - An infant's everyday visual environment is composed of a complex array of 
      entities, some of which are well integrated into their surroundings. Although 
      infants are already sensitive to some categories in their first year of life, it 
      is not clear which visual information supports their detection of meaningful 
      elements within naturalistic scenes. Here we investigated the impact of image 
      characteristics on 8-month-olds' search performance using a gaze contingent 
      eye-tracking search task. Infants had to detect a target patch on a background 
      image. The stimuli consisted of images taken from three categories: vegetation, 
      non-living natural elements (e.g., stones), and manmade artifacts, for which we 
      also assessed target background differences in lower- and higher-level visual 
      properties. Our results showed that larger target-background differences in the 
      statistical properties scaling invariance and entropy, and also stimulus 
      backgrounds including low pictorial depth, predicted better detection 
      performance. Furthermore, category membership only affected search performance if 
      supported by luminance contrast. Data from an adult comparison group also 
      indicated that infants' search performance relied more on lower-order visual 
      properties than adults. Taken together, these results suggest that infants use a 
      combination of property- and category-related information to parse complex visual 
      stimuli.

AB  - Infant electroencephalography (EEG) presents several challenges compared with 
      adult data: recordings are typically short and heavily contaminated by motion 
      artifacts, and the signal changes throughout development. Traditional data 
      preprocessing pipelines, developed mainly for event-related potential analyses, 
      require manual steps. However, larger datasets make this strategy infeasible. 
      Moreover, new analytical approaches may have different preprocessing 
      requirements. We propose an Automated Pipeline for Infants Continuous EEG 
      (APICE). APICE is fully automated, flexible, and modular. The use of multiple 
      algorithms and adaptive thresholds for artifact detection makes it suitable 
      across age groups and testing procedures. Furthermore, the preprocessing is 
      performed on continuous data, enabling better data recovery and flexibility 
      (i.e., the same preprocessing is usable for different analyzes). Here we describe 
      APICE and validate its performance in terms of data quality and data recovery 
      using two very different infant datasets. Specifically, (1) we show how APICE 
      performs when varying its artifacts rejection sensitivity; (2) we test the effect 
      of different data cleaning methods such as the correction of transient artifacts, 
      Independent Component Analysis, and Denoising Source Separation; and (3) we 
      compare APICE with other available pipelines. APICE uses EEGLAB and compatible 
      custom functions. It is freely available at 
      https://github.com/neurokidslab/eeg_preprocessing, together with example scripts.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is arising as a valuable method to investigate 
      neurocognitive functions shortly after birth. However, obtaining high-quality EEG 
      data from human newborn recordings is challenging. Compared to adults and older 
      infants, datasets are typically much shorter due to newborns' limited attentional 
      span and much noisier due to non-stereotyped artifacts mainly caused by 
      uncontrollable movements. We propose Newborn EEG Artifact Removal (NEAR), a 
      pipeline for EEG artifact removal designed explicitly for human newborns. NEAR is 
      based on two key steps: 1) A novel bad channel detection tool based on the Local 
      Outlier Factor (LOF), a robust outlier detection algorithm; 2) A parameter 
      calibration procedure for adapting to newborn EEG data the algorithm Artifacts 
      Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), developed for artifact removal in mobile adult 
      EEG. Tests on simulated data showed that NEAR outperforms existing methods in 
      removing representative newborn non-stereotypical artifacts. NEAR was validated 
      on two developmental populations (newborns and 9-month-old infants) recorded with 
      two different experimental designs (frequency-tagging and ERP). Results show that 
      NEAR artifact removal successfully reproduces established EEG responses from 
      noisy datasets, with a higher statistical significance than the one obtained by 
      existing artifact removal methods. The EEGLAB-based NEAR pipeline is freely 
      available at https://github.com/vpKumaravel/NEAR.

TI  - Upper-Body Post-activation Performance Enhancement for Athletic Performance: A 
      Systematic Review with Meta-analysis and Recommendations for Future Research.
PG  - 847-871
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01598-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) is 
      dominated by lower-body conditioning activities/performance test complexes. 
      Despite the contribution of the upper body to many sporting actions, no review on 
      upper-body PAPE currently exists. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review 
      with meta-analysis was to provide a synthesis of the available research on the 
      inclusion of upper-body PAPE conditioning activities to improve athletic 
      performance. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted according to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines, 
      including a literature search of EBSCOhost, SPORTDiscus, PubMed and Google 
      Scholar databases. A total of 127 studies were identified through database 
      searches, and were assessed against the following criteria: (1) randomised 
      controlled trial or pre-and-post study design; (2) studies explored the effects 
      of prior voluntary muscle activity, and not electrically induced contractions, 
      (3) evidence, or lack thereof, of PAPE was quantified by the monitoring of 
      individual performance to commonly applied physical tests or sport-specific 
      tasks; (4) conditioning activities and performance tests were primarily 
      upper-body; (5) detailed description of a standardised warm-up; and (6) full-text 
      versions of studies could be accessed in English language peer-reviewed journals. 
      Studies were quality assessed for methodological quality via the PEDro scale and 
      ranked accordingly. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. 
      Studies were classified into different conditioning activity modes: bench press 
      variations, sport-specific (modified implement throws, swing-specific, cable 
      pulley, elastic resistance, combination) and bodyweight activity. Acute 
      performance enhancement in several movement-specific combinations was found. A 
      meta-analysis revealed that bench press at  ≥ 80% one repetition maximum 
      significantly (p = 0.03; ES = 0.31) improves subsequent power output in the 
      ballistic bench throw at 30-40% one repetition maximum, following 8-12 min 
      recovery. Additionally, sport-specific overweight implement throws improved 
      subsequent throwing distance at competition weight by ~ 1.7-8.5%; ES = 0.14-0.33, 
      following 3 min recovery. Sport-specific lighter weighted bat swings and 
      swing-specific isometrics resulted in improved subsequent competition weight bat 
      swing velocities, ranging from ~ 1.3-4.9%; ES = 0.16-0.57. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review presents several upper-body movement-specific conditioning activities that 
      could be considered by coaches and practitioners as part of complex or contrast 
      training, or used in pre-competition warm-ups to acutely enhance performance.

TI  - LASSO Homotopy-Based Sparse Representation Classification for fNIRS-BCI.
LID - 10.3390/s22072575 [doi]
LID - 2575
AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as a way of facilitating communication 
      between the brain and peripheral devices. The BCI provides an option to improve 
      the walking pattern of people with poor walking dysfunction, by applying a 
      rehabilitation process. A state-of-the-art step-wise BCI system includes data 
      acquisition, pre-processing, channel selection, feature extraction, and 
      classification. In fNIRS-based BCI (fNIRS-BCI), channel selection plays a vital 
      role in enhancing the classification accuracy of the BCI problem. In this study, 
      the concentration of blood oxygenation (HbO) in a resting state and in a walking 
      state was used to decode the walking activity and the resting state of the 
      subject, using channel selection by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
      Operator (LASSO) homotopy-based sparse representation classification. The fNIRS 
      signals of nine subjects were collected from the left hemisphere of the primary 
      motor cortex. The subjects performed the task of walking on a treadmill for 10 s, 
      followed by a 20 s rest. Appropriate filters were applied to the collected 
      signals to remove motion artifacts and physiological noises. LASSO homotopy-based 
      sparse representation was used to select the most significant channels, and then 
      classification was performed to identify walking and resting states. For 
      comparison, the statistical spatial features of mean, peak, variance, and 
      skewness, and their combination, were used for classification. The classification 
      results after channel selection were then compared with the classification based 
      on the extracted features. The classifiers used for both methods were linear 
      discrimination analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic 
      regression (LR). The study found that LASSO homotopy-based sparse representation 
      classification successfully discriminated between the walking and resting states, 
      with a better average classification accuracy (p &lt; 0.016) of 91.32%. This 
      research provides a step forward in improving the classification accuracy of 
      fNIRS-BCI systems. The proposed methodology may also be used for rehabilitation 
      purposes, such as controlling wheelchairs and prostheses, as well as an active 
      rehabilitation training technique for patients with motor dysfunction.

AB  - Human anxiety is a grave mental health concern that needs to be addressed in the 
      appropriate manner in order to develop a healthy society. In this study, an 
      objective human anxiety assessment framework is developed by using physiological 
      signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and recorded in response to exposure 
      therapy. The EEG signals of twenty-three subjects from an existing database 
      called "A Database for Anxious States which is based on a Psychological 
      Stimulation (DASPS)" are used for anxiety quantification into two and four 
      levels. The EEG signals are pre-processed using appropriate noise filtering 
      techniques to remove unwanted ocular and muscular artifacts. Channel selection is 
      performed to select the significantly different electrodes using statistical 
      analysis techniques for binary and four-level classification of human anxiety, 
      respectively. Features are extracted from the data of selected EEG channels in 
      the frequency domain. Frequency band selection is applied to select the 
      appropriate combination of EEG frequency bands, which in this study are theta and 
      beta bands. Feature selection is applied to the features of the selected EEG 
      frequency bands. Finally, the selected subset of features from the appropriate 
      frequency bands of the statistically significant EEG channels were classified 
      using multiple machine learning algorithms. An accuracy of 94.90% and 92.74% is 
      attained for two and four-level anxiety classification using a random forest 
      classifier with 9 and 10 features, respectively. The proposed state anxiety 
      classification framework outperforms the existing anxiety detection framework in 
      terms of accuracy with a smaller number of features which reduces the 
      computational complexity of the algorithm.

TI  - EEG-fMRI: Ballistocardiogram Artifact Reduction by Surrogate Method for Improved 
      Source Localization.
PG  - 842420

AB  - For the analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, it is vital to use 
      effective artifact removal tools. This applies in particular to the 
      ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact which is difficult to remove without distorting 
      signals of interest related to brain activity. Here, we documented the use of 
      surrogate source models to separate the artifact-related signals from brain 
      signals with minimal distortion of the brain activity of interest. The artifact 
      topographies used for surrogate separation were created automatically using 
      principal components analysis (PCA-S) or by manual selection of artifact 
      components utilizing independent components analysis (ICA-S). Using real 
      resting-state data from 55 subjects superimposed with simulated auditory evoked 
      potentials (AEP), both approaches were compared with three established BCG 
      artifact removal methods: Blind Source Separation (BSS), Optimal Basis Set (OBS), 
      and a mixture of both (OBS-ICA). Each method was evaluated for its applicability 
      for ERP and source analysis using the following criteria: the number of events 
      surviving artifact threshold scans, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), error of source 
      localization, and signal variance explained by the dipolar model. Using these 
      criteria, PCA-S and ICA-S fared best overall, with highly significant differences 
      to the established methods, especially in source localization. The PCA-S approach 
      was also applied to a single subject Berger experiment performed in the MRI 
      scanner. Overall, the removal of BCG artifacts by the surrogate methods provides 
      a substantial improvement for the analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data compared 
      to the established methods.

TI  - Continuous Noninvasive Remote Automated Blood Pressure Monitoring With Novel 
      Wearable Technology: A Preliminary Validation Study.
PG  - e24916
LID - 10.2196/24916 [doi]
LID - e24916
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the 
      potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending 
      clinical deterioration. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud 
      DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood 
      pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to 
      examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of 
      application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. METHODS: Included 
      participants were ≥18 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac 
      intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants 
      for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the 
      effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation 
      procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 
      81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring 
      devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. 
      The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In 
      static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 
      seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive 
      arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP 
      measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, 
      and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable 
      connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were 
      interviewed about device acceptability. RESULTS: The validation analysis included 
      data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in 
      the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 
      seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), 
      respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position 
      were -0.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 
      1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were 
      slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 
      2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as 
      comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very 
      short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes 
      after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). CONCLUSIONS: We found 
      that the Cloud DX's Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance 
      with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced 
      within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by 
      patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy 
      of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a 
      longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and 
      signal quality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867;

AB  - As a convenient device for observing neural activity in the natural environment, 
      portable EEG technology (PEEGT) has an extensive prospect in expanding 
      neuroscience research into natural applications. However, unlike in the 
      laboratory environment, PEEGT is usually applied in a semiconstrained 
      environment, including management and engineering, generating much more artifacts 
      caused by the subjects' activities. Due to the limitations of existing artifacts 
      annotation, the problem limits PEEGT to take advantage of portability and 
      low-test cost, which is a crucial obstacle for the potential application of PEEGT 
      in the natural environment. This paper proposes an intelligent method to identify 
      two leading antecedent causes of EEG artifacts, participant's blinks and head 
      movements, and annotate the time segments of artifacts in real time based on 
      computer vision (CV). Furthermore, it changes the original postprocessing mode 
      based on artifact signal recognition to the preprocessing mode based on artifact 
      behavior recognition by the CV method. Through a comparative experiment with 
      three artifacts mark operators and the CV method, we verify the effectiveness of 
      the method, which lays a foundation for accurate artifact removal in real time in 
      the next step. It enlightens us on how to adopt computer technology to conduct 
      large-scale neurotesting in a natural semiconstrained environment outside the 
      laboratory without expensive laboratory equipment or high manual costs.

TI  - Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for Eye Blink Artifacts Removal

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are disrupted by technical and physiological 
      artifacts. One of the most common artifacts is the natural activity that results 
      from the movement of the eyes and the blinking of the subject. Eye blink 
      artifacts (EB) spread across the entire head surface and make EEG signal analysis 
      difficult. Methods for the elimination of electrooculography (EOG) artifacts, 
      such as independent component analysis (ICA) and regression, are known. The aim 
      of this article was to implement the convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
      eliminate eye blink artifacts. To train the CNN, a method for augmenting EEG 
      signals was proposed. The results obtained from the CNN were compared with the 
      results of the ICA and regression methods for the generated and real EEG signals. 
      The results obtained indicate a much better performance of the CNN in the task of 
      removing eye-blink artifacts, in particular for the electrodes located in the 
      central part of the head.

TI  - Computer-Assisted Assessment of the Interaction Between Arousals, 
      Breath-by-Breath Ventilation, and Chemical Drive During Cheyne-Stokes Respiration 
      in Heart Failure Patients.
PG  - 815352
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.815352 [doi]
LID - 815352
AB  - Transient increases in ventilation induced by arousal from sleep during 
      Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure patients are thought to contribute to 
      sustaining and exacerbating the ventilatory oscillation. The only possibility to 
      investigate the validity of this notion is to use observational data. This 
      entails some significant challenges: (i) accurate identification of both arousal 
      onset and offset; (ii) detection of short arousals (<3 s); (iii) breath-by-breath 
      analysis of the interaction between arousals and ventilation; (iv) careful 
      control for important confounding factors. In this paper we report how we have 
      tackled these challenges by developing innovative computer-assisted 
      methodologies. The identification of arousal onset and offset is performed by a 
      hybrid approach that integrates visual scoring with computer-based automated 
      analysis. We use a statistical detector to automatically discriminate between 
      dominant theta-delta and dominant alpha activity at each instant of time. 
      Moreover, a statistical detector is used to validate visual scoring of K 
      complexes, delta waves or artifacts associated with an EEG frequency shift, as 
      well as frequency shifts to beta activity. A high-resolution (250 ms) 
      state-transition diagram providing continuous information on the sleep-wake state 
      of the subject is finally obtained. Based on this information, arousals are 
      automatically identified as any state change from sleep to wakefulness lasting ≥2 
      s. The assessment of the interaction between arousals and ventilation is 
      performed using a breath-by-breath, case-control approach. The arousal-associated 
      change in ventilation is measured as the normalized difference between minute 
      ventilation in the case breath (i.e., with arousal) and that in the control 
      breath (i.e., without arousal), controlling for sleep stage and chemical drive. 
      The latter is estimated by using information from pulse oximetry at the finger. 
      In the last part of the paper, we discuss main potential sources of error 
      inherent in the described methodologies.

AB  - Interictal High Frequency Oscillations (HFO) are measurable in scalp EEG. This 
      development has aroused interest in investigating their potential as biomarkers 
      of epileptogenesis, seizure propensity, disease severity, and treatment response. 
      The demand for therapy monitoring in epilepsy has kindled interest in compact 
      wearable electronic devices for long-term EEG recording. Spiking neural networks 
      (SNN) have emerged as optimal architectures for embedding in compact low-power 
      signal processing hardware. We analyzed 20 scalp EEG recordings from 11 pediatric 
      focal lesional epilepsy patients. We designed a custom SNN to detect events of 
      interest (EoI) in the 80-250 Hz ripple band and reject artifacts in the 
      500-900 Hz band. We identified the optimal SNN parameters to detect EoI and 
      reject artifacts automatically. The occurrence of HFO thus detected was 
      associated with active epilepsy with 80% accuracy. The HFO rate mirrored the 
      decrease in seizure frequency in 8 patients (p = 0.0047). Overall, the HFO rate 
      correlated with seizure frequency (rho = 0.90 CI [0.75 0.96], p < 0.0001, 
      Spearman's correlation). The fully automated SNN detected clinically relevant HFO 
      in the scalp EEG. This study is a further step towards non-invasive epilepsy 
      monitoring with a low-power wearable device.

AB  - This paper presents a collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded from 
      40 subjects (female: 14, male: 26, mean age: 21.5 years). The dataset was 
      recorded from the subjects while performing various tasks such as Stroop 
      color-word test, solving arithmetic questions, identification of symmetric mirror 
      images, and a state of relaxation. The experiment was primarily conducted to 
      monitor the short-term stress elicited in an individual while performing the 
      aforementioned cognitive tasks. The individual tasks were carried out for 25 s 
      and were repeated to record three trials. The EEG was recorded using a 32-channel 
      Emotiv Epoc Flex gel kit. The EEG data were then segmented into non-overlapping 
      epochs of 25 s depending on the various tasks performed by the subjects. The EEG 
      data were further processed to remove the baseline drifts by subtracting the 
      average trend obtained using the Savitzky-Golay filter. Furthermore, the 
      artifacts were also removed from the EEG data by applying wavelet thresholding. 
      The dataset proposed in this paper can aid and support the research activities in 
      the field of brain-computer interface and can also be used in the identification 
      of patterns in the EEG data elicited due to stress.

TI  - Are High Frequency Oscillations in Scalp EEG Related to Age?
PG  - 722657
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2021.722657 [doi]
LID - 722657
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have received much attention in 
      recent years, particularly in the clinical context. In addition to their 
      application as a marker for pathological changes in patients with epilepsy, HFOs 
      have also been brought into context with several physiological mechanisms. 
      Furthermore, recent studies reported a relation between an increase of HFO rate 
      and age in invasive EEG recordings. The present study aimed to investigate 
      whether this relation can be replicated in scalp-EEG. METHODS: We recorded 
      high-density EEG from 11 epilepsy patients at rest as well as during motor 
      performance. Manual detection of HFOs was performed by two independent raters 
      following a standardized protocol. Patients were grouped by age into younger (<25 
      years) and older (>50 years) participants. RESULTS: No significant difference of 
      HFO-rates was found between groups [U = 10.5, p = 0.429, r = 0.3]. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lack of replicability of the age effect of HFOs may be due to the local 
      propagation patterns of age-related HFOs occurring in deep structures. However, 
      limitations such as small sample size, decreased signal-to-noise ratio as 
      compared to invasive recordings, as well as HFO-mimicking artifacts must be 
      considered.

TI  - SSA with CWT and k-Means for Eye-Blink Artifact Removal from Single-Channel EEG 
      Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s22030931 [doi]
LID - 931
AB  - Recently, the use of portable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices to record brain 
      signals in both health care monitoring and in other applications, such as fatigue 
      detection in drivers, has been increased due to its low cost and ease of use. 
      However, the measured EEG signals always mix with the electrooculogram (EOG), 
      which are results due to eyelid blinking or eye movements. The 
      eye-blinking/movement is an uncontrollable activity that results in a 
      high-amplitude slow-time varying component that is mixed in the measured EEG 
      signal. The presence of these artifacts misled our understanding of the 
      underlying brain state. As the portable EEG devices comprise few EEG channels or 
      sometimes a single EEG channel, classical artifact removal techniques such as 
      blind source separation methods cannot be used to remove these artifacts from a 
      single-channel EEG signal. Hence, there is a demand for the development of new 
      single-channel-based artifact removal techniques. Singular spectrum analysis 
      (SSA) has been widely used as a single-channel-based eye-blink artifact removal 
      technique. However, while removing the artifact, the low-frequency components 
      from the non-artifact region of the EEG signal are also removed by SSA. To 
      preserve these low-frequency components, in this paper, we have proposed a new 
      methodology by integrating the SSA with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and 
      the k-means clustering algorithm that removes the eye-blink artifact from the 
      single-channel EEG signals without altering the low frequencies of the EEG 
      signal. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG signals. 
      The results also show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing 
      methods.

TI  - Closed-Loop Torque and Kinematic Control of a Hybrid Lower-Limb Exoskeleton for 
      Treadmill Walking.
PG  - 702860

AB  - Restoring and improving the ability to walk is a top priority for individuals 
      with movement impairments due to neurological injuries. Powered exoskeletons 
      coupled with functional electrical stimulation (FES), called hybrid exoskeletons, 
      exploit the benefits of activating muscles and robotic assistance for locomotion. 
      In this paper, a cable-driven lower-limb exoskeleton is integrated with FES for 
      treadmill walking at a constant speed. A nonlinear robust controller is used to 
      activate the quadriceps and hamstrings muscle groups via FES to achieve kinematic 
      tracking about the knee joint. Moreover, electric motors adjust the knee joint 
      stiffness throughout the gait cycle using an integral torque feedback controller. 
      For the hip joint, a robust sliding-mode controller is developed to achieve 
      kinematic tracking using electric motors. The human-exoskeleton dynamic model is 
      derived using Lagrangian dynamics and incorporates phase-dependent switching to 
      capture the effects of transitioning from the stance to the swing phase, and vice 
      versa. Moreover, low-level control input switching is used to activate individual 
      muscles and motors to achieve flexion and extension about the hip and knee 
      joints. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is developed to ensure exponential 
      tracking of the kinematic and torque closed-loop error systems, while 
      guaranteeing that the control input signals remain bounded. The developed 
      controllers were tested in real-time walking experiments on a treadmill in three 
      able-bodied individuals at two gait speeds. The experimental results demonstrate 
      the feasibility of coupling a cable-driven exoskeleton with FES for treadmill 
      walking using a switching-based control strategy and exploiting both kinematic 
      and force feedback.

AB  - Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect 
      patient's health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the 
      mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic 
      seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for 
      preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine 
      learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. 
      However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such 
      as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to "pops" in the signal, 
      resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through 
      visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic 
      detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an 
      essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. 
      These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes 
      that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While 
      preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and 
      classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This 
      paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers 
      over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding 
      and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.

AB  - Brain computer interface (BCI) requires an online and real-time processing of EEG 
      signals. Hence, the accuracy of the recording system is improved by nullifying 
      the developed artifacts. The goal of this proposal is to develop a hybrid model 
      for recognizing and minimizing ocular artifacts through an improved deep learning 
      scheme. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Pisarenko harmonic decomposition 
      are used for decomposing the signals. Then, the features are extracted by 
      principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) 
      techniques. After collecting the features, an optimized deformable convolutional 
      network (ODCN) is used for the recognition of ocular artifacts from EEG input 
      signals. When artifacts are sensed, the moderation method is executed by applying 
      the empirical mean curve decomposition (EMCD) followed by ODCN for noise 
      optimization in EEG signals. Conclusively, the spotless signal is reconstructed 
      by an application of inverse EMCD. The proposed method has achieved a higher 
      performance than that of conventional methods, which demonstrates a better ocular 
      artifact reduction by the proposed method.

TI  - Refining epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations using deep learning: a reverse 
      engineering approach.
PG  - fcab267
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcab267 [doi]
LID - fcab267
AB  - Intracranially recorded interictal high-frequency oscillations have been proposed 
      as a promising spatial biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. However, its visual 
      verification is time-consuming and exhibits poor inter-rater reliability. 
      Furthermore, no method is currently available to distinguish high-frequency 
      oscillations generated from the epileptogenic zone (epileptogenic high-frequency 
      oscillations) from those generated from other areas (non-epileptogenic 
      high-frequency oscillations). To address these issues, we constructed a deep 
      learning-based algorithm using chronic intracranial EEG data via subdural grids 
      from 19 children with medication-resistant neocortical epilepsy to: (i) replicate 
      human expert annotation of artefacts and high-frequency oscillations with or 
      without spikes, and (ii) discover epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations by 
      designing a novel weakly supervised model. The 'purification power' of deep 
      learning is then used to automatically relabel the high-frequency oscillations to 
      distill epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations. Using 12 958 annotated 
      high-frequency oscillation events from 19 patients, the model achieved 96.3% 
      accuracy on artefact detection (F1 score = 96.8%) and 86.5% accuracy on 
      classifying high-frequency oscillations with or without spikes (F1 score = 80.8%) 
      using patient-wise cross-validation. Based on the algorithm trained from 84 602 
      high-frequency oscillation events from nine patients who achieved seizure-freedom 
      after resection, the majority of such discovered epileptogenic high-frequency 
      oscillations were found to be ones with spikes (78.6%, P < 0.001). While the 
      resection ratio of detected high-frequency oscillations (number of resected 
      events/number of detected events) did not correlate significantly with 
      post-operative seizure freedom (the area under the curve = 0.76, P = 0.06), the 
      resection ratio of epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations positively 
      correlated with post-operative seizure freedom (the area under the curve = 0.87, 
      P = 0.01). We discovered that epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations had a 
      higher signal intensity associated with ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple 
      (250-500 Hz) bands at the high-frequency oscillation onset and with a lower 
      frequency band throughout the event time window (the inverted T-shaped), compared 
      to non-epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations. We then designed perturbations 
      on the input of the trained model for non-epileptogenic high-frequency 
      oscillations to determine the model's decision-making logic. The model confidence 
      significantly increased towards epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations by the 
      artificial introduction of the inverted T-shaped signal template (mean 
      probability increase: 0.285, P < 0.001), and by the artificial insertion of 
      spike-like signals into the time domain (mean probability increase: 0.452, 
      P < 0.001). With this deep learning-based framework, we reliably replicated 
      high-frequency oscillation classification tasks by human experts. Using a reverse 
      engineering technique, we distinguished epileptogenic high-frequency oscillations 
      from others and identified its salient features that aligned with current 
      knowledge.

TI  - Similar Hemodynamic Signal Patterns Between Compact NIRS and 52-Channel NIRS 
      During a Verbal Fluency Task.
PG  - 772339

AB  - Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), including 52-channel NIRS 
      (52ch-NIRS), has been used increasingly to capture hemodynamic changes in the 
      brain because of its safety, low cost, portability, and high temporal resolution. 
      However, optode caps might cause pain and motion artifacts if worn for extended 
      periods of time because of the weight of the cables and the pressure of the 
      optodes on the scalp. Recently, a small NIRS apparatus called compact NIRS 
      (cNIRS) has been developed, and uses only a few flexible sensors. Because this 
      device is expected to be more suitable than 52ch-NIRS in the clinical practice 
      for patients with children or psychiatric conditions, we tested whether the two 
      systems were clinically comparable. Specifically, we evaluated the correlation 
      between patterns of hemodynamic changes generated by 52ch-NIRS and cNIRS in the 
      frontopolar region. We scanned 14 healthy adults with 52ch-NIRS and cNIRS, and 
      measured activation patterns of oxygenated-hemoglobin [oxy-Hb] and 
      deoxygenated-hemoglobin [deoxy-Hb] in the frontal pole while they performed a 
      verbal fluency task. We performed detailed temporal domain comparisons of 
      time-course patterns between the two NIRS-based signals. We found that 52ch-NIRS 
      and cNIRS showed significant correlations in [oxy-Hb] and [deoxy-Hb] time-course 
      changes in numerous channels. Our findings indicate that cNIRS and 52ch-NIRS 
      capture similar task-dependent hemodynamic changes due to metabolic demand, which 
      supports the validity of cNIRS measurement techniques. Therefore, this small 
      device has a strong potential for clinical application with infants and children, 
      as well as for use in the rehabilitation or treatment of patients with 
      psychiatric disorders using biofeedback.

AB  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a conventional approach to exclude 
      non-brain signals such as eye movements and muscle artifacts from 
      electroencephalography (EEG). A rejection of independent components (ICs) is 
      usually performed in semiautomatic mode and requires experts' involvement. As 
      also revealed by our study, experts' opinions about the nature of a component 
      often disagree, highlighting the need to develop a robust and sustainable 
      automatic system for EEG ICs classification. The current article presents a 
      toolbox and crowdsourcing platform for Automatic Labeling of Independent 
      Components in Electroencephalography (ALICE) available via link 
      http://alice.adase.org/. The ALICE toolbox aims to build a sustainable algorithm 
      to remove artifacts and find specific patterns in EEG signals using ICA 
      decomposition based on accumulated experts' knowledge. The difference from 
      previous toolboxes is that the ALICE project will accumulate different benchmarks 
      based on crowdsourced visual labeling of ICs collected from publicly available 
      and in-house EEG recordings. The choice of labeling is based on the estimation of 
      IC time-series, IC amplitude topography, and spectral power distribution. The 
      platform allows supervised machine learning (ML) model training and re-training 
      on available data subsamples for better performance in specific tasks (i.e., 
      movement artifact detection in healthy or autistic children). Also, current 
      research implements the novel strategy for consentient labeling of ICs by several 
      experts. The provided baseline model could detect noisy IC and components related 
      to the functional brain oscillations such as alpha and mu rhythm. The ALICE 
      project implies the creation and constant replenishment of the IC database, which 
      will improve ML algorithms for automatic labeling and extraction of non-brain 
      signals from EEG. The toolbox and current dataset are open-source and freely 
      available to the researcher community.

AB  - Active balance control is critical for performing many of our everyday 
      activities. Our nervous systems rely on multiple sensory inputs to inform 
      cortical processing, leading to coordinated muscle actions that maintain balance. 
      However, such cortical processing can be challenging to record during mobile 
      balance tasks due to limitations in noninvasive neuroimaging and motion artifact 
      contamination. Here, we present a synchronized, multi-modal dataset from 30 
      healthy, young human participants during standing and walking while undergoing 
      brief sensorimotor perturbations. Our dataset includes 20 total hours of 
      high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from 128 scalp electrodes, 
      along with surface electromyography (EMG) from 10 neck and leg electrodes, 
      electrooculography (EOG) recorded from 3 electrodes, and 3D body position from 2 
      sensors. In addition, we include  ∼  18000 total balance perturbation events 
      across participants. To facilitate data reuse, we share this dataset in the Brain 
      Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) data standard and publicly release code that 
      replicates our previous event-related findings.

AB  - Automated systems for identifying and removing non-neural ICA components are 
      growing in popularity among EEG researchers of adult populations. Infant EEG data 
      differs in many ways from adult EEG data, but there exists almost no specific 
      system for automated classification of source components from paediatric 
      populations. Here, we adapt one of the most popular systems for adult ICA 
      component classification for use with infant EEG data. Our adapted classifier 
      significantly outperformed the original adult classifier on samples of 
      naturalistic free play EEG data recorded from 10 to 12-month-old infants, 
      achieving agreement rates with the manual classification of over 75% across two 
      validation studies (n = 44, n = 25). Additionally, we examined both classifiers' 
      ability to remove stereotyped ocular artifact from a basic visual processing ERP 
      dataset compared to manual ICA data cleaning. Here, the new classifier performed 
      on level with expert manual cleaning and was again significantly better than the 
      adult classifier at removing artifact whilst retaining a greater amount of 
      genuine neural signal operationalised through comparing ERP activations in time 
      and space. Our new system (iMARA) offers developmental EEG researchers a flexible 
      tool for automatic identification and removal of artifactual ICA components.

TI  - Seizures induced in electroconvulsive therapy as a human epilepsy model: A 
      comparative case study.
PG  - 672-684
LID - 10.1002/epi4.12532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Standardized investigation of epileptic seizures and the postictal 
      state may contribute to a better understanding of ictal and postictal phenomena. 
      This comparative case study aims to assess whether electrically induced seizures 
      in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) show sufficient similarities with spontaneous 
      seizures to serve as a human epilepsy model. METHODS: We compared six EEG 
      recordings, three ECT-induced seizures and three generalized tonic-clonic 
      seizures, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. EEG 
      recordings during and after ECT sessions (under general anesthesia and muscle 
      paralysis) were collected prospectively, whereas epilepsy data were selected 
      retrospectively. Time-frequency representations, dominant ictal frequencies, and 
      postictal alpha-delta ratios were calculated. RESULTS: In all EEG recordings, a 
      decrease in dominant ictal frequency was observed, as well as postictal 
      suppression. Postictal alpha-delta ratio indicated the same trend for all: a 
      gradual increase from predominantly delta to alpha frequencies on timescales of 
      hours after the seizure. Postictal spectral representation was similar. Muscle 
      artifacts were absent in ECT-induced seizures and present in spontaneous 
      seizures. Ictal amplitude was higher in epileptic than in ECT-induced seizures. 
      Temporospectral ictal dynamics varied slightly between groups. SIGNIFICANCE: We 
      show that ictal and postictal characteristics in ECT and patients with 
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures are essentially similar. ECT-induced seizures 
      may be used to investigate aspects of ictal and postictal states in a highly 
      predictable manner and well-controlled environment. This suggests that clinical 
      and electrophysiological observations during ECT may be extrapolated to epilepsy 
      with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

TI  - A novel strategy for driving car brain-computer interfaces: Discrimination of 
      EEG-based visual-motor imagery.

AB  - A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on kinesthetic motor imagery has a 
      potential of becoming a groundbreaking technology in a clinical setting. However, 
      few studies focus on a visual-motor imagery (VMI) paradigm driving BCI. The 
      VMI-BCI feature extraction methods are yet to be explored in depth. In this 
      study, a novel VMI-BCI paradigm is proposed to execute four VMI tasks: imagining 
      a car moving forward, reversing, turning left, and turning right. These mental 
      strategies can naturally control a car or robot to move forward, backward, left, 
      and right. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 25 subjects were collected. After 
      the raw EEG signal baseline was corrected, the alpha band was extracted using 
      bandpass filtering. The artifacts were removed by independent component analysis. 
      Then, the EEG average instantaneous energy induced by VMI (VMI-EEG) was 
      calculated using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The autoregressive model was 
      extracted to construct a 12-dimensional feature vector to a support vector 
      machine suitable for small sample classification. This was classified into 
      two-class tasks: visual imagination of driving the car forward versus reversing, 
      driving forward versus turning left, driving forward versus turning right, 
      reversing versus turning left, reversing versus turning right, and turning left 
      versus turning right. The results showed that the average classification accuracy 
      of these two-class tasks was 62.68 ± 5.08%, and the highest classification 
      accuracy was 73.66 ± 6.80%. The study showed that EEG features of O1 and O2 
      electrodes in the occipital region extracted by HHT were separable for these VMI 
      tasks.

      Subjects.

LID - 7711
AB  - The raw EEG signal is always contaminated with many different artifacts, such as 
      muscle movements (electromyographic artifacts), eye blinking (electrooculographic 
      artifacts) or power line disturbances. All artifacts must be removed for correct 
      data interpretation. However, various noise reduction methods significantly 
      influence the final shape of the EEG signal and thus its characteristic values, 
      latency and amplitude. There are several types of filters to eliminate noise 
      early in the processing of EEG data. However, there is no gold standard for their 
      use. This article aims to verify and compare the influence of four various 
      filters (FIR, IIR, FFT, NOTCH) on the latency and amplitude of the EEG signal. By 
      presenting a comparison of selected filters, the authors intend to raise 
      awareness among researchers as regards the effects of known filters on latency 
      and amplitude in a selected area-the sensorimotor area.

TI  - Epileptic Seizures Detection in EEG Signals Using Fusion Handcrafted and Deep 
      Learning Features.
LID - 10.3390/s21227710 [doi]
LID - 7710
AB  - Epilepsy is a brain disorder disease that affects people's quality of life. 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are used to diagnose epileptic seizures. 
      This paper provides a computer-aided diagnosis system (CADS) for the automatic 
      diagnosis of epileptic seizures in EEG signals. The proposed method consists of 
      three steps, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In 
      order to perform the simulations, the Bonn and Freiburg datasets are used. 
      Firstly, we used a band-pass filter with 0.5-40 Hz cut-off frequency for removal 
      artifacts of the EEG datasets. Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT) is used for EEG 
      signal decomposition. In the second step, various linear and nonlinear features 
      are extracted from TQWT sub-bands. In this step, various statistical, frequency, 
      and nonlinear features are extracted from the sub-bands. The nonlinear features 
      used are based on fractal dimensions (FDs) and entropy theories. In the 
      classification step, different approaches based on conventional machine learning 
      (ML) and deep learning (DL) are discussed. In this step, a CNN-RNN-based DL 
      method with the number of layers proposed is applied. The extracted features have 
      been fed to the input of the proposed CNN-RNN model, and satisfactory results 
      have been reported. In the classification step, the K-fold cross-validation with 
      k = 10 is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-RNN 
      classification procedure. The results revealed that the proposed CNN-RNN method 
      for Bonn and Freiburg datasets achieved an accuracy of 99.71% and 99.13%, 
      respectively.

TI  - Suppressing of Power Line Artifact From Electroencephalogram Measurements Using 
      Sparsity in Frequency Domain.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an important role in brain disease diagnosis and 
      research of brain-computer interface (BCI). However, the measurements of EEG are 
      often exposed to strong interference of power line artifact (PLA). Digital notch 
      filters (DNFs) can be applied to remove the PLA effectively, but it also results 
      in severe signal distortions in the time domain. To address this problem, 
      spectrum correction (SC) based methods can be utilized. These methods estimate 
      harmonic parameters of the PLA such that compensation signals are produced to 
      remove the noise. In order to ensure high accuracy during harmonic parameter 
      estimations, a novel approach is proposed in this paper. This novel approach is 
      based on the combination of sparse representation (SR) and SC. It can deeply mine 
      the information of PLA in the frequency domain. Firstly, a ratio-based spectrum 
      correction (RBSC) using rectangular window is employed to make rough estimation 
      of the harmonic parameters of PLA. Secondly, the two spectral line closest to the 
      estimated frequency are calculated. Thirdly, the two spectral lines with high 
      amplitudes can be utilized as input of RBSC to make finer estimations of the 
      harmonic parameters. Finally, a compensation signal, based on the extracted 
      harmonic parameters, is generated to suppress PLA. Numerical simulations and 
      actual EEG signals with PLA were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      improved approach. It is verified that this approach can effectively suppress the 
      PLA without distorting the time-domain waveform of the EEG signal.

AB  - The study assessed a mobile electroencephalography system with water-based 
      electrodes for its applicability in cognitive and behavioural neuroscience. It 
      was compared to a standard gel-based wired system. Electroencephalography was 
      recorded on two occasions (first with gel-based, then water-based system) as 
      participants completed the flanker task. Technical and practical considerations 
      for the application of the water-based system are reported based on participant 
      and experimenter experiences. Empirical comparisons focused on 
      electroencephalography data noise levels, frequency power across four bands 
      (theta, alpha, low beta and high beta) and event-related components (P300 and 
      ERN). The water-based system registered more noise compared to the gel-based 
      system which resulted in increased loss of data during artefact rejection. 
      Signal-to-noise ratio was significantly lower for the water-based system in the 
      parietal channels which affected the observed parietal beta power. It also led to 
      a shift in topography of the maximal P300 activity from parietal to frontal 
      regions. The water-based system may be prone to slow drift noise which may affect 
      the reliability and consistency of low-frequency band analyses. Practical 
      considerations for the use of water-based electrode electroencephalography 
      systems are provided.

TI  - Prefrontal Lobe and Posterior Cingulate Cortex Activations in Patients with Major 
      Depressive Disorder by Using Standardized Weighted Low-Resolution Electromagnetic 
      Tomography.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11111054 [doi]
LID - 1054
AB  - BACKGROUND: The differences in brain activity between patients with major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy adults have been confirmed by functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and 
      electroencephalography (EEG). The prefrontal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex 
      (PCC) are related to emotional regulation in patients with MDD. However, the high 
      cost and poor time resolution of fMRI and PET limit their clinical application. 
      Recently, researchers have used high time resolution of standardized weighted 
      low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (swLORETA) to investigate deep brain 
      activity. This study aimed to convert raw EEG signals into swLORETA images and 
      explore deep brain activity in patients with MDD and healthy adults. METHODS: 
      BrainMaster EEG equipment with a 19-channel EEG cap was used to collect resting 
      EEG data with eyes closed for 5 min. NeuroGuide software was used to remove the 
      EEG artifacts, and the swLORETA software was used to analyze 12,700 voxels of 
      current source density (CSD) for 139 patients with MDD and co-morbid anxiety 
      symptoms (mean age = 43.08, SD = 13.76; 28.78% were male) and 134 healthy adults 
      (mean age = 40.60, SD = 13.52; 34.33% were male). Deep brain activity in the 
      frontal lobe and PCC at different frequency bands was analyzed, including delta 
      (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), beta (12-24 Hz), beta1 (12-14 Hz), 
      beta2 (15-17 Hz), beta3 (18-24 Hz), and high beta (25-29 Hz). RESULTS: There was 
      lower delta and theta and higher beta, beta1, beta2, beta3, and high-beta 
      activity at the prefrontal lobe (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex [dmPFC], ventral 
      medial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC], and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC], 
      ventral lateral prefrontal cortex [vlPFC], orbital frontal cortex [OFC]) and PCC 
      in MDD patients compared with healthy adults. There was no significant difference 
      in alpha activity between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates brain 
      hyperactivity in the right prefrontal lobe (dlPFC and vmPFC) and PCC in patients 
      with MDD with co-morbid anxiety symptoms, and the dlPFC and PCC were also related 
      to emotion regulation in MDD. Inhibiting high-beta activity or restoring delta 
      and theta activity to the normal range in the right frontal lobe and PCC may be 
      possible in z-score neurofeedback protocols for patients with MDD in future 
      studies.

TI  - A Novel Method Based on Combination of Independent Component Analysis and 
      Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition for Removing Electrooculogram Artifacts 
      From Multichannel Electroencephalogram Signals.
PG  - 729403
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2021.729403 [doi]
LID - 729403
AB  - Electrooculogram (EOG) is one of common artifacts in recorded 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Many existing methods including independent 
      component analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform were applied to eliminate EOG 
      artifacts but ignored the possible impact of the nature of EEG signal. Therefore, 
      the removal of EOG artifacts still faces a major challenge in EEG research. In 
      this paper, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and ICA algorithms 
      were combined to propose a novel EEMD-based ICA method (EICA) for removing EOG 
      artifacts from multichannel EEG signals. First, the ICA method was used to 
      decompose original EEG signals into multiple independent components (ICs), and 
      the EOG-related ICs were automatically identified through the kurtosis method. 
      Then, by performing the EEMD algorithm on EOG-related ICs, the intrinsic mode 
      functions (IMFs) linked to EOG were discriminated and eliminated. Finally, 
      artifact-free IMFs were projected to obtain the ICs without EOG artifacts, and 
      the clean EEG signals were ultimately reconstructed by the inversion of ICA. Both 
      EOGs correction from simulated EEG signals and real EEG data were studied, which 
      verified that the proposed method could achieve an improved performance in EOG 
      artifacts rejection. By comparing with other existing approaches, the EICA 
      obtained the optimal performance with the highest increase in signal-to-noise 
      ratio and decrease in root mean square error and correlation coefficient after 
      EOG artifacts removal, which demonstrated that the proposed method could more 
      effectively eliminate blink artifacts from multichannel EEG signals with less 
      error influence. This study provided a novel promising method to eliminate EOG 
      artifacts with high performance, which is of great importance for EEG signals 
      processing and analysis.

TI  - EEG Monitoring Is Feasible and Reliable during Simultaneous Transcutaneous 
      Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulation.
LID - 10.3390/s21196593 [doi]
LID - 6593
AB  - Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a non-invasive 
      neuromodulatory technique that has in recent years been linked to improved 
      volitional limb control in spinal-cord injured individuals. Although the 
      technique is growing in popularity there is still uncertainty regarding the 
      neural mechanisms underpinning sensory and motor recovery. Brain monitoring 
      techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) may provide further insights to 
      the changes in coritcospinal excitability that have already been demonstrated 
      using other techniques. It is unknown, however, whether intelligible EEG can be 
      extracted while tSCS is being applied, owing to substantial high-amplitude 
      artifacts associated with stimulation-based therapies. Here, for the first time, 
      we characterise the artifacts that manifest in EEG when recorded simultaneously 
      with tSCS. We recorded multi-channel EEG from 21 healthy volunteers as they took 
      part in a resting state and movement task across two sessions: One with tSCS 
      delivered to the cervical region of the neck, and one without tSCS. An offline 
      analysis in the time and frequency domain showed that tSCS manifested as narrow, 
      high-amplitude peaks with a spectral density contained at the stimulation 
      frequency. We quantified the altered signals with descriptive 
      statistics-kurtosis, root-mean-square, complexity, and zero crossings-and applied 
      artifact-suppression techniques-superposition of moving averages, adaptive, 
      median, and notch filtering-to explore whether the effects of tSCS could be 
      suppressed. We found that the superposition of moving averages filter was the 
      most successful technique at returning contaminated EEG to levels statistically 
      similar to that of normal EEG. In the frequency domain, however, notch filtering 
      was more effective at reducing the spectral power contribution of stimulation 
      from frontal and central electrodes. An adaptive filter was more appropriate for 
      channels closer to the stimulation site. Lastly, we found that tSCS posed no 
      detriment the binary classification of upper-limb movements from sensorimotor 
      rhythms, and that adaptive filtering resulted in poorer classification 
      performance. Overall, we showed that, depending on the analysis, EEG monitoring 
      during transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation is feasible. This study 
      supports future investigations using EEG to study the activity of the 
      sensorimotor cortex during tSCS, and potentially paves the way to brain-computer 
      interfaces operating in the presence of spinal stimulation.

TI  - Motion artefact removal in electroencephalography and electrocardiography by 
      using multichannel inertial measurement units and adaptive filtering.
PG  - 128-138
LID - 10.1049/htl2.12016 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a new active electrode design for electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors based on inertial measurement units to remove 
      motion artefacts during signal acquisition. Rather than measuring motion data 
      from a single source for the entire recording unit, inertial measurement units 
      are attached to each individual EEG or ECG electrode to collect local movement 
      data. This data is then used to remove the motion artefact by using normalised 
      least mean square adaptive filtering. Results show that the proposed active 
      electrode design can reduce motion contamination from EEG and ECG signals in 
      chest movement and head swinging motion scenarios. However, it is found that the 
      performance varies, necessitating the need for the algorithm to be paired with 
      more sophisticated signal processing to identify scenarios where it is beneficial 
      in terms of improving signal quality. The new instrumentation hardware allows 
      data driven artefact removal to be performed, providing a new data driven 
      approach compared to widely used blind-source separation methods, and helps 
      enable in the wild EEG recordings to be performed.

TI  - Wireless Soft Scalp Electronics and Virtual Reality System for Motor 
      Imagery-Based Brain-Machine Interfaces.
PG  - e2101129

AB  - Motor imagery offers an excellent opportunity as a stimulus-free paradigm for 
      brain-machine interfaces. Conventional electroencephalography (EEG) for motor 
      imagery requires a hair cap with multiple wired electrodes and messy gels, 
      causing motion artifacts. Here, a wireless scalp electronic system with virtual 
      reality for real-time, continuous classification of motor imagery brain signals 
      is introduced. This low-profile, portable system integrates imperceptible 
      microneedle electrodes and soft wireless circuits. Virtual reality addresses 
      subject variance in detectable EEG response to motor imagery by providing clear, 
      consistent visuals and instant biofeedback. The wearable soft system offers 
      advantageous contact surface area and reduced electrode impedance density, 
      resulting in significantly enhanced EEG signals and classification accuracy. The 
      combination with convolutional neural network-machine learning provides a 
      real-time, continuous motor imagery-based brain-machine interface. With four 
      human subjects, the scalp electronic system offers a high classification accuracy 
      (93.22 ± 1.33% for four classes), allowing wireless, real-time control of a 
      virtual reality game.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs) allow one to 
      assess cortical excitability and effective connectivity in clinical and basic 
      research. However, obtaining clean TEPs is challenging due to the various 
      TMS-related artifacts that contaminate the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal 
      when the TMS pulse is delivered. Different preprocessing approaches have been 
      employed to remove the artifacts, but the degree of artifact reduction or signal 
      distortion introduced in this phase of analysis is still unknown. Knowing and 
      controlling this potential source of uncertainty will increase the inter-rater 
      reliability of TEPs and improve the comparability between TMS-EEG studies. The 
      goal of this study was to assess the variability in TEP waveforms due to of the 
      use of different preprocessing pipelines. To accomplish this aim, we preprocessed 
      the same TMS-EEG data with four different pipelines and compared the results. The 
      dataset was obtained from 16 subjects in two identical recording sessions, each 
      session consisting of both left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left inferior 
      parietal lobule stimulation at 100% of the resting motor threshold. Considerable 
      differences in TEP amplitudes and global mean field power (GMFP) were found 
      between the preprocessing pipelines. Topographies of TEPs from the different 
      pipelines were all highly correlated (ρ>0.8) at latencies over 100 ms. By 
      contrast, waveforms at latencies under 100 ms showed a variable level of 
      correlation, with ρ ranging between 0.2 and 0.9. Moreover, the test-retest 
      reliability of TEPs depended on the preprocessing pipeline. Taken together, these 
      results take us to suggest that the choice of the preprocessing approach has a 
      marked impact on the final TEP, and that further studies are needed to understand 
      advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches.

TI  - Automated Detection and Removal of Cardiac and Pulse Interferences from Neonatal 
      EEG Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s21196364 [doi]
LID - 6364
AB  - Electrical cardiac and pulsatile interference is very difficult to remove from 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, especially if recorded in neonates, for 
      which a small number of EEG channels is used. Several methods were proposed, 
      including Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods that required the use of 
      artificial cardiac-related signals to improve the separation of artefactual 
      components. To optimize the separation of cardiac-related artefactual components, 
      we propose a method based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that exploits 
      specific features of the real electrocardiographic (ECG) signals that were 
      simultaneously recorded with the neonatal EEG. A total of forty EEG segments from 
      19-channel neonatal EEG recordings with and without seizures were used to test 
      and validate the performance of our method. We observed a significant reduction 
      in the number of independent components (ICs) containing cardiac-related 
      interferences, with a consequent improvement in the automated classification of 
      the separated ICs. The comparison with the expert labeling of the ICs separately 
      containing electrical cardiac and pulsatile interference led to an accuracy = 
      0.99, a false omission rate = 0.01 and a sensitivity = 0.93, outperforming 
      existing methods. Furthermore, we verified that true brain activity was preserved 
      in neonatal EEG signals reconstructed after the removal of artefactual ICs, 
      demonstrating the effectiveness of our method and its safe applicability in a 
      clinical context.

TI  - Identification of Ictal Tachycardia in Focal Motor- and Non-Motor Seizures by 
      Means of a Wearable PPG Sensor.
LID - 10.3390/s21186017 [doi]
LID - 6017
AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) as an additional biosignal for a seizure detector has 
      been underutilized so far, which is possibly due to its susceptibility to motion 
      artifacts. We investigated 62 focal seizures from 28 patients with 
      electrocardiography-based evidence of ictal tachycardia (IT). Seizures were 
      divided into subgroups: those without epileptic movements and those with 
      epileptic movements not affecting and affecting the extremities. PPG-based heart 
      rate (HR) derived from a wrist-worn device was calculated for sections with high 
      signal quality, which were identified using spectral entropy. Overall, IT based 
      on PPG was identified in 37 of 62 (60%) seizures (9/19, 7/8, and 21/35 in the 
      three groups, respectively) and could be found prior to the onset of epileptic 
      movements affecting the extremities in 14/21 seizures. In 30/37 seizures, 
      PPG-based IT was in good temporal agreement (<10 s) with ECG-based IT, with an 
      average delay of 5.0 s relative to EEG onset. In summary, we observed that the 
      identification of IT by means of a wearable PPG sensor is possible not only for 
      non-motor seizures but also in motor seizures, which is due to the early 
      manifestation of IT in a relevant subset of focal seizures. However, both 
      spontaneous and epileptic movements can impair PPG-based seizure detection.

TI  - A Fast Approach to Removing Muscle Artifacts for EEG with Signal Serialization 
      Based Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition.
LID - 10.3390/e23091170 [doi]
LID - 1170
AB  - An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrophysiological signal reflecting the 
      functional state of the brain. As the control signal of the brain-computer 
      interface (BCI), EEG may build a bridge between humans and computers to improve 
      the life quality for patients with movement disorders. The collected EEG signals 
      are extremely susceptible to the contamination of electromyography (EMG) 
      artifacts, affecting their original characteristics. Therefore, EEG denoising is 
      an essential preprocessing step in any BCI system. Previous studies have 
      confirmed that the combination of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) 
      and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can effectively suppress EMG artifacts. 
      However, the time-consuming iterative process of EEMD may limit the application 
      of the EEMD-CCA method in real-time monitoring of BCI. Compared with the existing 
      EEMD, the recently proposed signal serialization based EEMD (sEEMD) is a good 
      choice to provide effective signal analysis and fast mode decomposition. In this 
      study, an EMG denoising method based on sEEMD and CCA is discussed. All of the 
      analyses are carried out on semi-simulated data. The results show that, in terms 
      of frequency and amplitude, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by 
      sEEMD are consistent with the IMFs obtained by EEMD. There is no significant 
      difference in the ability to separate EMG artifacts from EEG signals between the 
      sEEMD-CCA method and the EEMD-CCA method (p > 0.05). Even in the case of heavy 
      contamination (signal-to-noise ratio is less than 2 dB), the relative root mean 
      squared error is about 0.3, and the average correlation coefficient remains above 
      0.9. The running speed of the sEEMD-CCA method to remove EMG artifacts is 
      significantly improved in comparison with that of EEMD-CCA method (p < 0.05). The 
      running time of the sEEMD-CCA method for three lengths of semi-simulated data is 
      shortened by more than 50%. This indicates that sEEMD-CCA is a promising tool for 
      EMG artifact removal in real-time BCI systems.

TI  - Data-driven beamforming technique to attenuate ballistocardiogram artefacts in 
      electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging without detecting 
      cardiac pulses in electrocardiography recordings.
PG  - 3993-4021
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25535 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) is a very promising non-invasive neuroimaging technique. 
      However, EEG data obtained from the simultaneous EEG-fMRI are strongly influenced 
      by MRI-related artefacts, namely gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram 
      (BCG) artefacts. When compared to the GA correction, the BCG correction is more 
      challenging to remove due to its inherent variabilities and dynamic changes over 
      time. The standard BCG correction (i.e., average artefact subtraction [AAS]), 
      require detecting cardiac pulses from simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) 
      recording. However, ECG signals are also distorted and will become problematic 
      for detecting reliable cardiac peaks. In this study, we focused on a beamforming 
      spatial filtering technique to attenuate all unwanted source activities outside 
      of the brain. Specifically, we applied the beamforming technique to attenuate the 
      BCG artefact in EEG-fMRI, and also to recover meaningful task-based neural 
      signals during an attentional network task (ANT) which required participants to 
      identify visual cues and respond accurately. We analysed EEG-fMRI data in 20 
      healthy participants during the ANT, and compared four different BCG corrections 
      (non-BCG corrected, AAS BCG corrected, beamforming + AAS BCG corrected, 
      beamforming BCG corrected). We demonstrated that the beamforming approach did not 
      only significantly reduce the BCG artefacts, but also significantly recovered the 
      expected task-based brain activity when compared to the standard AAS correction. 
      This data-driven beamforming technique appears promising especially for longer 
      data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI. Our findings extend previous work 
      regarding the recovery of meaningful EEG signals by an optimized suppression of 
      MRI-related artefacts.

TI  - Choosing Strategies to Deal with Artifactual EEG Data in Children with Cognitive 
      Impairment.
LID - 10.3390/e23081030 [doi]
LID - 1030
AB  - Rett syndrome is a disease that involves acute cognitive impairment and, 
      consequently, a complex and varied symptomatology. This study evaluates the EEG 
      signals of twenty-nine patients and classify them according to the level of 
      movement artifact. The main goal is to achieve an artifact rejection strategy 
      that performs well in all signals, regardless of the artifact level. Two 
      different methods have been studied: one based on the data distribution and the 
      other based on the energy function, with entropy as its main component. The 
      method based on the data distribution shows poor performance with signals 
      containing high amplitude outliers. On the contrary, the method based on the 
      energy function is more robust to outliers. As it does not depend on the data 
      distribution, it is not affected by artifactual events. A double rejection 
      strategy has been chosen, first on a motion signal (accelerometer or EEG low-pass 
      filtered between 1 and 10 Hz) and then on the EEG signal. The results showed a 
      higher performance when working combining both artifact rejection methods. The 
      energy-based method, to isolate motion artifacts, and the data-distribution-based 
      method, to eliminate the remaining lower amplitude artifacts were used. In 
      conclusion, a new method that proves to be robust for all types of signals is 
      designed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is highly informative yet technically challenging. 
      Until recently, there has been little information about EEG data quality and 
      safety when used with newer multi-band (MB) fMRI sequences. Here, we measure the 
      relative heating of a MB protocol compared with a standard single-band (SB) 
      protocol considered to be safe. We also evaluated EEG quality recorded 
      concurrently with the MB protocol on humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 
      radiofrequency (RF)-related heating at multiple electrodes and magnetic field 
      magnitude, B1+RMS, of a MB fMRI sequence with whole-brain coverage (TR = 440 ms, 
      MB factor = 4) against a previously recommended, safe SB sequence using a phantom 
      outfitted with a 64-channel EEG cap. Next, 9 human subjects underwent eyes-closed 
      resting state EEG-fMRI using the MB sequence. Additionally, in three of the 
      subjects resting state EEG was recorded also during the SB sequence and in an 
      fMRI-free condition to directly compare EEG data quality across scanning 
      conditions. EEG data quality was assessed by the ability to remove gradient and 
      cardioballistic artifacts along with a clean spectrogram. RESULTS: The heating 
      induced by the MB sequence was lower than that of the SB sequence by a factor of 
      0.73 ± 0.38. This is consistent with an expected heating ratio of 0.64, 
      calculated from the square of the ratio of B1+RMS values of the sequences. In the 
      resting state EEG data, gradient and cardioballistic artifacts were successfully 
      removed using traditional template subtraction. All subjects showed an individual 
      alpha peak in the spectrogram with a posterior topography characteristic of 
      eyes-closed EEG. The success of artifact rejection for the MB sequence was 
      comparable to that in traditional SB sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that 
      B1+RMS is a useful indication of the relative heating of fMRI protocols. This 
      observation indicates that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings using this MB 
      sequence can be safe in terms of RF-related heating, and that EEG data recorded 
      using this sequence is of acceptable quality after traditional artifact removal 
      techniques.

TI  - EEG Artifact Removal System for Depression Using a Hybrid Denoising Approach.
PG  - 465-476
LID - 10.32598/bcn.2021.1388.2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several computer-aided diagnosis systems for depression are 
      suggested for use by clinicians to authorize the diagnosis. EEG may be used as an 
      objective analysis tool for identifying depression in the initial stage to avoid 
      it from reaching a severe and permanent state. However, artifact contamination 
      reduces the accuracy in EEG signal processing systems. METHODS: This work 
      proposes a novel denoising method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) 
      (with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and wavelet packet transform. 
      Initially, real EEG recordings corresponding to depression patients are 
      decomposed into various mode functions by applying EMD. Then, DFA is used as the 
      mode selection criteria. Further Wavelet Packets Decomposition (WPD)-based 
      evaluation is applied to extract the cleaner signal. RESULTS: Simulations were 
      conducted on real EEG databases for depression to demonstrate the effects of the 
      proposed techniques. To conclude the efficacy of the proposed technique, SNR and 
      MAE were identified. The obtained results indicated improved signal-to-noise 
      ratio and lower values of MAE for the combined EMD-DFA-WPD technique. 
      Additionally, Random Forest and SVM (Support Vector Machine)-based classification 
      revealed the improved accuracy of 98.51% and 98.10% for the proposed denoising 
      technique. Whereas the accuracy of the EMD- DFA is 98.01% and 95.81% and EMD 
      combined with DWT technique equaled98.0% and 97.21% for the EMD- DFA technique 
      for RF and SVM, respectively, compared to the proposed method. Furthermore, the 
      classification performance for both classifiers was compared with and without 
      denoising to highlight the effects of the proposed technique. CONCLUSION: 
      Proposed denoising system results in better classification of depressed and 
      healthy individuals resulting in a better diagnosing system. These results can be 
      further analyzed using other approaches as a solution to the mode mixing problem 
      of the EMD approach.

TI  - Internal Consistency of Sway Measures via Embedded Head-Mounted Accelerometers: 
      Implications for Neuromotor Investigations.
LID - 10.3390/s21134492 [doi]
LID - 4492
AB  - Accelerometers are being increasingly incorporated into neuroimaging devices to 
      enable real-time filtering of movement artifacts. In this study, we evaluate the 
      reliability of sway metrics derived from these accelerometers in a standard 
      eyes-open balance assessment to determine their utility in multimodal study 
      designs. Ten participants equipped with a head-mounted accelerometer performed an 
      eyes-open standing condition on 7 consecutive days. Sway performance was 
      quantified with 4 standard metrics: root-mean-square (RMS) acceleration, 
      peak-to-peak (P2P) acceleration, jerk, and ellipse area. Intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC) quantified reliability. P2P in both the mediolateral (ICC = 
      0.65) and anteroposterior (ICC = 0.67) planes yielded the poorest reliability. 
      Both ellipse area and RMS exhibited good reliability, ranging from 0.76 to 0.84 
      depending on the plane. Finally, jerk displayed the highest reliability with an 
      ICC value of 0.95. Moderate to excellent reliability was observed in all sway 
      metrics. These findings demonstrate that head-mounted accelerometers, commonly 
      found in neuroimaging devices, can be used to reliably assess sway. These data 
      validate the use of head-mounted accelerometers in the assessment of motor 
      control alongside other measures of brain activity such as electroencephalography 
      (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).

TI  - Deep learning of resting-state electroencephalogram signals for three-class 
      classification of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and healthy 
      ageing.
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ac05d8 [doi]
AB  - Objective.This study aimed to produce a novel deep learning (DL) model for the 
      classification of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) subjects and healthy ageing (HA) subjects using resting-state 
      scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.Approach.The raw EEG data were 
      pre-processed to remove unwanted artefacts and sources of noise. The data were 
      then processed with the continuous wavelet transform, using the Morse mother 
      wavelet, to create time-frequency graphs with a wavelet coefficient scale range 
      of 0-600. The graphs were combined into tiled topographical maps governed by the 
      10-20 system orientation for scalp electrodes. The application of this processing 
      pipeline was used on a data set of resting-state EEG samples from age-matched 
      groups of 52 AD subjects (82.3 ± 4.7 years of age), 37 MCI subjects (78.4 ± 5.1 
      years of age) and 52 HA subjects (79.6 ± 6.0 years of age). This resulted in the 
      formation of a data set of 16197 topographical images. This image data set was 
      then split into training, validation and test images and used as input to an 
      AlexNet DL model. This model was comprised of five hidden convolutional layers 
      and optimised for various parameters such as learning rate, learning rate 
      schedule, optimiser, and batch size.Main results.The performance was assessed by 
      a tenfold cross-validation strategy, which produced an average accuracy result of 
      98.9 ± 0.4% for the three-class classification of AD vs MCI vs HA. The results 
      showed minimal overfitting and bias between classes, further indicating the 
      strength of the model produced.Significance.These results provide significant 
      improvement for this classification task compared to previous studies in this 
      field and suggest that DL could contribute to the diagnosis of AD from EEG 
      recordings.

LID - 10.3390/brainsci11060743 [doi]
LID - 743
AB  - The sense of agency (SoA) is part of psychophysiological modules related to the 
      self. Disturbed SoA is found in several clinical conditions, hence understanding 
      the neural correlates of the SoA is useful for the diagnosis and determining the 
      proper treatment strategies. Although there are several neuroimaging studies on 
      SoA, it is desirable to translate the knowledge to more accessible and 
      inexpensive EEG-based biomarkers for the sake of applicability. However, SoA has 
      not been widely investigated using EEG. To address this issue, we designed an EEG 
      experiment on healthy adults (n = 15) to determine the sensitivity of EEG on the 
      SoA paradigm using hand movement with parametrically delayed visual feedback. We 
      calculated the power spectral density over the traditional EEG frequency bands 
      for ten delay conditions relative to no delay condition. Independent component 
      analysis and equivalent current dipole modeling were applied to address artifact 
      rejection, volume conduction, and source localization to determine the effect of 
      interest. The results revealed that the alpha and low-beta EEG power increased in 
      the parieto-occipital regions in proportion to the reduced SoA reported by the 
      subjects. We conclude that the parieto-occipital alpha and low-beta EEG power 
      reflect the sense of agency.

AB  - Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can affect perception, 
      learning and cognition, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. A 
      promising strategy to elucidate these mechanisms aims at applying tACS while 
      electric or magnetic brain oscillations targeted by stimulation are recorded. 
      However, reconstructing brain oscillations targeted by tACS remains a challenging 
      problem due to stimulation artifacts. Besides lack of an established strategy to 
      effectively supress such stimulation artifacts, there are also no resources 
      available that allow for the development and testing of new and effective tACS 
      artefact suppression algorithms, such as adaptive spatial filtering using 
      beamforming or signal-space projection. Here, we provide a full dataset 
      comprising encephalographic (EEG) recordings across six healthy human volunteers 
      who underwent 10-Hz amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) during a 10-Hz 
      steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm. Moreover, data and 
      scripts are provided related to the validation of a novel stimulation artefact 
      suppression strategy, Stimulation Artifact Source Separation (SASS), removing EEG 
      signal components that are maximally different in the presence versus absence of 
      stimulation. Besides including EEG single-trial data and comparisons of 10-Hz 
      brain oscillatory phase and amplitude recorded across three conditions (condition 
      1: no stimulation, condition 2: stimulation with SASS, condition 3: stimulation 
      without SASS), also power spectra and topographies of SSVEP amplitudes across all 
      three conditions are presented. Moreover, data is provided for assessing 
      nonlinear modulations of the stimulation artifact in both time and frequency 
      domains due to heartbeats. Finally, the dataset includes eigenvalue spectra and 
      spatial patterns of signal components that were identified and removed by SASS 
      for stimulation artefact suppression at the target frequency. Besides providing a 
      valuable resource to assess properties of AM-tACS artifacts in the EEG, this 
      dataset allows for testing different artifact rejection methods and offers 
      in-depth insights into the workings of SASS.

TI  - Building an Open Source Classifier for the Neonatal EEG Background: A Systematic 
      Feature-Based Approach From Expert Scoring to Clinical Visualization.

AB  - Neonatal brain monitoring in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) requires a 
      continuous review of the spontaneous cortical activity, i.e., the 
      electroencephalograph (EEG) background activity. This needs development of 
      bedside methods for an automated assessment of the EEG background activity. In 
      this paper, we present development of the key components of a neonatal EEG 
      background classifier, starting from the visual background scoring to classifier 
      design, and finally to possible bedside visualization of the classifier results. 
      A dataset with 13,200 5-minute EEG epochs (8-16 channels) from 27 infants with 
      birth asphyxia was used for classifier training after scoring by two independent 
      experts. We tested three classifier designs based on 98 computational features, 
      and their performance was assessed with respect to scoring system, pre- and 
      post-processing of labels and outputs, choice of channels, and visualization in 
      monitor displays. The optimal solution achieved an overall classification 
      accuracy of 97% with a range across subjects of 81-100%. We identified a set of 
      23 features that make the classifier highly robust to the choice of channels and 
      missing data due to artefact rejection. Our results showed that an automated 
      bedside classifier of EEG background is achievable, and we publish the full 
      classifier algorithm to allow further clinical replication and validation 
      studies.

AB  - Transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS) in the frequency range of 
      1-100 Hz has come to be used routinely in electroencephalogram (EEG) studies of 
      brain function through entrainment of neuronal oscillations. It turned out, 
      however, to be highly non-trivial to remove the strong stimulation signal, 
      including its harmonic and non-harmonic distortions, as well as various induced 
      higher-order artifacts from the EEG data recorded during the stimulation. In this 
      paper, we discuss some of the problems encountered and present methodological 
      approaches aimed at overcoming them. To illustrate the mechanisms of artifact 
      induction and the proposed removal strategies, we use data obtained with the help 
      of a schematic demonstrator setup as well as human-subject data.

TI  - Eye-blink artifact removal from single channel EEG with k-means and SSA.
PG  - 11043

AB  - In recent years, the usage of portable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices are 
      becoming popular for both clinical and non-clinical applications. In order to 
      provide more comfort to the subject and measure the EEG signals for several 
      hours, these devices usually consists of fewer EEG channels or even with a single 
      EEG channel. However, electrooculogram (EOG) signal, also known as eye-blink 
      artifact, produced by involuntary movement of eyelids, always contaminate the EEG 
      signals. Very few techniques are available to remove these artifacts from single 
      channel EEG and most of these techniques modify the uncontaminated regions of the 
      EEG signal. In this paper, we developed a new framework that combines 
      unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means) and singular spectrum analysis 
      (SSA) technique to remove eye blink artifact without modifying actual EEG signal. 
      The novelty of the work lies in the extraction of the eye-blink artifact based on 
      the time-domain features of the EEG signal and the unsupervised machine learning 
      algorithm. The extracted eye-blink artifact is further processed by the SSA 
      method and finally subtracted from the contaminated single channel EEG signal to 
      obtain the corrected EEG signal. Results with synthetic and real EEG signals 
      demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods. 
      Moreover, the frequency based measures [the power spectrum ratio ([Formula: see 
      text]) and the mean absolute error (MAE)] also show that the proposed method does 
      not modify the uncontaminated regions of the EEG signal while removing the 
      eye-blink artifact.

TI  - Expression-EEG Bimodal Fusion Emotion Recognition Method Based on Deep Learning.
PG  - 9940148

LID - 9940148
AB  - As one of the key issues in the field of emotional computing, emotion recognition 
      has rich application scenarios and important research value. However, the single 
      biometric recognition in the actual scene has the problem of low accuracy of 
      emotion recognition classification due to its own limitations. In response to 
      this problem, this paper combines deep neural networks to propose a deep 
      learning-based expression-EEG bimodal fusion emotion recognition method. This 
      method is based on the improved VGG-FACE network model to realize the rapid 
      extraction of facial expression features and shorten the training time of the 
      network model. The wavelet soft threshold algorithm is used to remove artifacts 
      from EEG signals to extract high-quality EEG signal features. Then, based on the 
      long- and short-term memory network models and the decision fusion method, the 
      model is built and trained using the signal feature data extracted under the 
      expression-EEG bimodality to realize the final bimodal fusion emotion 
      classification and identification research. Finally, the proposed method is 
      verified based on the MAHNOB-HCI data set. Experimental results show that the 
      proposed model can achieve a high recognition accuracy of 0.89, which can 
      increase the accuracy of 8.51% compared with the traditional LSTM model. In terms 
      of the running time of the identification method, the proposed method can 
      effectively be shortened by about 20 s compared with the traditional method.

TI  - Electroencephalography in Orthostatic Tremor: A Prospective Study of 30 Patients.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.5334/tohm.596 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthostatic tremor (OT) is characterized by a sensation of 
      instability while standing, associated with high frequency (1318 Hz) tremor in 
      the legs. Small retrospective series have reported electroencephalography (EEG) 
      findings in OT with discordant results. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 30 OT 
      subjects. Mean age = 68.3 (range 5487) with mean disease duration 16.3 years 
      (range 444). A modified 1020 system EEG recording with additional midline 
      electrodes was obtained. EMG electrodes were placed on quadricep muscles. EEG 
      recording was performed at rest, during sleep and while standing unassisted. 
      RESULTS: In all subjects, EEG showed normal background, normal drowsiness and/or 
      stage 2 sleep, and normal responses to hyperventilation and photic stimulation. 
      These normal results persisted during stance. EEG abnormalities were found in 3 
      subjects (anterior-mid temporal slow activity), but were not position-dependent 
      and were judged unlikely to be related to OT. Tremor artifact while standing was 
      noted in all subjects, however it was measurable in 26 with frequency in the OT 
      range in 25. When compared with EMG, the average difference in frequency was 
      small at 1.2 Hz (range 0.52.5, p 0.46). Visual EEG analysis in OT patients did 
      not reveal electrographic abnormalities even upon standing unassisted. 
      DISCUSSION: EEG was normal on this prospective, relatively large OT series. 
      Clinicians interpreting video-EEGs should be aware of the OT artifact that can be 
      seen in EEG and EKG leads mostly while standing.

TI  - A Portable Waterproof EEG Acquisition Device for Dolphins.

LID - 3336
AB  - The acquisition and analysis of EEG signals of dolphins, a highly intelligent 
      creature, has always been a focus of the research of bioelectric signals. 
      Prevailing cable-connected devices cannot be adapted to data acquisition very 
      well when dolphins are in motion. Therefore, this study designs a novel, 
      light-weighted, and portable EEG acquisition device aimed at relatively 
      unrestricted EEG acquisition. An embedded main control board and an acquisition 
      board were designed, and all modules are encapsulated in a 162 × 94 × 60 mm(3) 
      waterproof device box, which can be tied to the dolphin's body by a silicon belt. 
      The acquisition device uses customized suction cups with embedded electrodes and 
      adopts a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with the ground station. The 
      sampled signals are written to the memory card on board when the Bluetooth 
      communication is blocked. A limited experiment was designed to verify the 
      effectiveness of the device functionality onshore and underwater. However, more 
      rigorous long-term tests on dolphins in various states with our device are 
      expected in future to further prove its capability and study the movement-related 
      artifacts.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.51275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate local short-term neuroplasticity elicited by 
      subthalamic, thalamic, and pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement 
      disorders. METHODS: During DBS surgery, we delivered pairs of stimulus pulses 
      with both circular and directional leads across 90 interstimulus intervals in 17 
      participants and recorded local field potentials from unused contacts on the 
      implanted electrode array. We removed the stimulus artifact, validated the neural 
      origin of the underlying signals, and examined short-term plasticity as a 
      function of interstimulus interval and DBS target, using linear mixed effects 
      models. RESULTS: DBS evokes short latency local field potentials that are readily 
      detected with both circular and directional leads at all stimulation targets 
      (0.31 ± 0.10 msec peak latency, mean ± SD). Peak amplitude, area, and latency are 
      modified strongly by interstimulus interval (P < 0.001) and display absolute and 
      relative refractory periods (0.56 ± 0.08 and 2.94 ± 1.05 msec, respectively). We 
      also identified later oscillatory activity in the subthalamic-pallidal circuit 
      (4.50 ± 1.11 msec peak latency) that displays paired pulse facilitation (present 
      in 5/8 subthalamic, 4/5 pallidal, and 0/6 thalamic trajectories, P = 0.018, 
      Fisher's exact test), and correlates with resting beta frequency power 
      (P < 0.001), therapeutic DBS frequencies, and stimulation sites chosen later for 
      therapy in the ambulatory setting (P = 0.031). INTERPRETATION: Paired DBS pulses 
      synchronize local circuit electrophysiology and elicit short-term neuroplasticity 
      in the subthalamic-pallidal circuit. Collectively, these responses likely 
      represent the earliest detectable interaction between the DBS pulse and local 
      neuronal tissue in humans. Evoked subcortical field potentials could serve as a 
      predictive biomarker to guide the implementation of next-generation directional 
      and adaptive stimulation devices.

AB  - The upper limit of rate-based pitch perception and rate discrimination can differ 
      substantially across cochlear implant (CI) users. One potential reason for this 
      difference is the presence of a biological limitation on temporal encoding in the 
      electrically-stimulated auditory pathway, which can be inherent to the electrical 
      stimulation itself and/or to the degenerative processes associated with hearing 
      loss. Electrophysiological measures, like the electrically-evoked frequency 
      following response (eFFR) and auditory change complex (eACC), could potentially 
      provide valuable insights in the temporal processing limitations at the level of 
      the brainstem and cortex in the electrically-stimulated auditory pathway. 
      Obtaining these neural responses, free from stimulation artifacts, is 
      challenging, especially when the neural response is phase-locked to the 
      stimulation rate, as is the case for the eFFR. In this study we investigated the 
      feasibility of measuring eFFRs, free from stimulation artifacts, to stimulation 
      rates ranging from 94 to 196 pulses per second (pps) and eACCs to pulse rate 
      changes ranging from 36 to 108%, when stimulating in a monopolar configuration. A 
      high-sampling rate EEG system was used to measure the electrophysiological 
      responses in five CI users, and linear interpolation was applied to remove the 
      stimulation artifacts from the EEG. With this approach, we were able to measure 
      eFFRs for pulse rates up to 162 pps and eACCs to the different rate changes. Our 
      results show that it is feasible to measure electrophysiological responses, free 
      from stimulation artifacts, that could potentially be used as neural correlates 
      for rate and pitch processing in CI users.

AB  - Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography 
      (EEG) enables a non-invasive investigation of the human brain function and 
      evaluation of the correlation of these two important modalities of brain 
      activity. This paper explores recent reports on using advanced simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI methods proposed to map the regions and networks involved in focal 
      epileptic seizure generation. One of the applications of EEG and fMRI combination 
      as a valuable clinical approach is the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with 
      epilepsy to map and localize the precise brain regions associated with 
      epileptiform activity. In the process of conventional analysis using EEG-fMRI 
      data, the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are visually extracted from 
      the EEG data to be convolved as binary events with a predefined hemodynamic 
      response function (HRF) to provide a model of epileptiform BOLD activity and use 
      as a regressor for general linear model (GLM) analysis of the fMRI data. This 
      review examines the methodologies involved in performing such studies, including 
      techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, 
      and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. It then discusses the results 
      reported for patients with primary generalized epilepsy and patients with 
      different types of focal epileptic disorders. An important matter that these 
      results have brought to light is that the brain regions affected by interictal 
      epileptic discharges might not be limited to the ones where they have been 
      generated. The developed methods can help reveal the regions involved in or 
      affected by a seizure onset zone (SOZ). As confirmed by the reviewed literature, 
      EEG-fMRI provides information that comes particularly useful when evaluating 
      patients with refractory epilepsy for surgery.

AB  - Electroencephography (EEG) recordings from CI listeners are contaminated by 
      electrical artefacts that make it difficult to extract neural responses. 
      Previously, we have removed these artefacts by means of interpolation and spatial 
      filtering. However, the extent to which this method can effectively reduce 
      electrical artefacts has not been fully investigated. Here, we assessed the 
      effectiveness of interpolation and spatial filtering to remove electrical 
      artefacts using recordings from a human head specimen implanted with a 
      CI.•Electrical artefacts were obtained using amplitude-modulated (AM'ed) pulse 
      trains presented at several pulse rates (100-to-902 pps) or using high rate pulse 
      trains (902 pps) in which either a pair of electrodes or AM frequencies 
      alternated periodically at a rate of 1Hz.•By adding auditory change complex 
      (ACC), auditory steady-state response (ASSR), or auditory change following 
      response (AC-FR) template waveforms to the contaminated recordings, we show that 
      interpolation allows for effective artefact removal for pulse rates below 400 pps 
      whilst interpolation and spatial filtering are effective at higher pulse rates, 
      with minimal distortions for ACC and AC-FR, and with a degree of amplitude- and 
      phase-distortions for ASSR.•Recordings from CI listeners agreed with simulations, 
      demonstrating that reliable responses can be recovered.

TI  - Photoplethysmography in Normal and Pathological Sleep.
LID - 10.3390/s21092928 [doi]
LID - 2928
AB  - This article presents an overview of the advancements that have been made in the 
      use of photoplethysmography (PPG) for unobtrusive sleep studies. PPG is included 
      in the quickly evolving and very popular landscape of wearables but has specific 
      interesting properties, particularly the ability to capture the modulation of the 
      autonomic nervous system during sleep. Recent advances have been made in PPG 
      signal acquisition and processing, including coupling it with accelerometry in 
      order to construct hypnograms in normal and pathologic sleep and also to detect 
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The limitations of PPG (e.g., oxymetry signal 
      failure, motion artefacts, signal processing) are reviewed as well as technical 
      solutions to overcome these issues. The potential medical applications of PPG are 
      numerous, including home-based detection of SDB (for triage purposes), and 
      long-term monitoring of insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (to assess 
      treatment effects), and treated SDB (to ensure disease control). New contact 
      sensor combinations to improve future wearables seem promising, particularly 
      tools that allow for the assessment of brain activity. In this way, in-ear EEG 
      combined with PPG and actigraphy could be an interesting focus for future 
      research.

AB  - People are able to modify the spontaneous pace of their actions to interact with 
      their environment and others. This ability is underpinned by high-level cognitive 
      functions but little is known in regard to the brain areas that underlie such 
      temporal control. A salient practical issue is that current neuroimaging 
      techniques (e.g., EEG, fMRI) are extremely sensitive to movement, which renders 
      challenging any investigation of brain activity in the realm of whole-body motor 
      paradigms. Within the last decade, the noninvasive imaging method of functional 
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has become the reference tool for experimental 
      motor paradigms due to its tolerance to motion artefacts. In the present study, 
      we used a continuous-wave fNIRS system to record the prefrontal and motor 
      hemodynamic responses of 16 participants, while they performed a spatial-tapping 
      task varying in motor complexity and externally-paced tempi (i.e., 300 ms, 500 
      ms, 1200 ms). To discriminate between physiological noise and cerebral meaningful 
      signals, the physiological data (i.e., heart and respiratory rates) were recorded 
      so that frequency bands of such signals could be regressed from the fNIRS data. 
      Particular attention was taken to control the precise position of the optodes in 
      reference to the cranio-cerebral correlates of the NIR channels throughout the 
      experimental session. Results indicated that fast pacing relied on greater 
      activity of the motor areas whereas moving at close-to-spontaneous pace placed a 
      heavier load on posterior prefrontal processes. These results provide new insight 
      concerning the role of frontal cognitive control in modulating the pacing of 
      voluntary motor behaviors.

TI  - Adaptive Filtering for Improved EEG-Based Mental Workload Assessment of Ambulant 
      Users.
PG  - 611962

LID - 611962
AB  - Recently, due to the emergence of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) devices, 
      assessment of mental workload in highly ecological settings has gained 
      popularity. In such settings, however, motion and other common artifacts have 
      been shown to severely hamper signal quality and to degrade mental workload 
      assessment performance. Here, we show that classical EEG enhancement algorithms, 
      conventionally developed to remove ocular and muscle artifacts, are not optimal 
      in settings where participant movement (e.g., walking or running) is expected. As 
      such, an adaptive filter is proposed that relies on an accelerometer-based 
      referential signal. We show that when combined with classical algorithms, 
      accurate mental workload assessment is achieved. To test the proposed algorithm, 
      data from 48 participants was collected as they performed the Revised 
      Multi-Attribute Task Battery-II (MATB-II) under a low and a high workload 
      setting, either while walking/jogging on a treadmill, or using a stationary 
      exercise bicycle. Accuracy as high as 95% could be achieved with a random forest 
      based mental workload classifier with ambulant users. Moreover, an increase in 
      gamma activity was found in the parietal cortex, suggesting a connection between 
      sensorimotor integration, attention, and workload in ambulant users.

TI  - Measures of prefrontal functional near-infrared spectroscopy in visuomotor 
      learning.
PG  - 1061-1072
LID - 10.1007/s00221-021-06039-2 [doi]
AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising technique for 
      non-invasively assessing cortical brain activity during learning. This technique 
      is safe, portable, and, compared to other imaging techniques, relatively robust 
      to head motion, ocular and muscular artifacts and environmental noise. Moreover, 
      the spatial resolution of fNIRS is superior to electroencephalography (EEG), a 
      more commonly applied technique for measuring brain activity non-invasively 
      during learning. Outcomes from fNIRS measures during learning might therefore be 
      both sensitive to learning and to feedback on learning, in a different way than 
      EEG. However, few studies have examined fNIRS outcomes in learning and no study 
      to date additionally examined the effects of feedback. To address this apparent 
      gap in the literature, the current study examined prefrontal cortex activity 
      measured through fNIRS during visuomotor learning and how this measure is 
      affected by task feedback. Activity in the prefrontal cortex decreased over the 
      course of learning while being unaffected by task feedback. The findings 
      demonstrate that fNIRS in the prefrontal cortex is valuable for assessing 
      visuomotor learning and that this measure is robust to task feedback. The current 
      study highlights the potential of fNIRS in assessing learning even under 
      different task feedback conditions.

TI  - RT-NET: real-time reconstruction of neural activity using high-density 
      electroencephalography.
PG  - 251-266
LID - 10.1007/s12021-020-09479-3 [doi]
AB  - High-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) has been successfully used for 
      large-scale investigations of neural activity in the healthy and diseased human 
      brain. Because of their high computational demand, analyses of source-projected 
      hdEEG data are typically performed offline. Here, we present a real-time 
      noninvasive electrophysiology toolbox, RT-NET, which has been specifically 
      developed for online reconstruction of neural activity using hdEEG. RT-NET relies 
      on the Lab Streaming Layer for acquiring raw data from a large number of EEG 
      amplifiers and for streaming the processed data to external applications. RT-NET 
      estimates a spatial filter for artifact removal and source activity 
      reconstruction using a calibration dataset. This spatial filter is then applied 
      to the hdEEG data as they are acquired, thereby ensuring low latencies and 
      computation times. Overall, our analyses show that RT-NET can estimate real-time 
      neural activity with performance comparable to offline analysis methods. It may 
      therefore enable the development of novel brain-computer interface applications 
      such as source-based neurofeedback.

AB  - The theta rhythm organizes neural activity across hippocampus and entorhinal 
      cortex. A role for theta oscillations in spatial navigation is supported by half 
      a century of research reporting that theta frequency encodes running speed 
      linearly so that displacement can be estimated through theta frequency 
      integration. We show that this relationship is an artifact caused by the fact 
      that the speed of freely moving animals could not be systematically disentangled 
      from acceleration. Using an experimental procedure that clamps running speed at 
      pre-set values, we find that the theta frequency of local field potentials and 
      spike activity is linearly related to positive acceleration, but not negative 
      acceleration or speed. The modulation by positive-only acceleration makes 
      rhythmic activity at theta frequency unfit as a code to compute displacement or 
      any other kinematic variable. Temporally precise variations in theta frequency 
      may instead serve as a mechanism for speeding up entorhinal-hippocampal 
      computations during accelerated movement.

TI  - High-pass filtering artifacts in multivariate classification of neural time 
      series data.
PG  - 109080
LID - S0165-0270(21)00015-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, EEG/MEG data are high-pass filtered and 
      baseline-corrected to remove slow drifts. Minor deleterious effects of high-pass 
      filtering in traditional time-series analysis have been well-documented, 
      including temporal displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved 
      multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) are largely unknown. NEW 
      METHOD: To prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an alternative 
      method of removing slow drift noise - robust detrending - with a procedure in 
      which we mask out all cortical events from each trial. We refer to this method as 
      trial-masked robust detrending. RESULTS: In both real and simulated EEG data of a 
      working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass filtering and standard 
      robust detrending create artifacts that result in the displacement of 
      multivariate patterns into activity silent periods, particularly apparent in 
      temporal generalization analyses, and especially in combination with baseline 
      correction. We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such 
      displacements. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Temporal displacement may 
      emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings such as 0.05 Hz, and even in 
      regular robust detrending. However, trial-masked robust detrending results in 
      artifact-free decoding without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly 
      obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest of the trial. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Decoding analyses benefit from trial-masked robust detrending, 
      without the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering or regular robust 
      detrending. However, for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong 
      signals, no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately. Implications for 
      other types of data are discussed, followed by a number of recommendations.

TI  - Are age and sex effects on sleep slow waves only a matter of electroencephalogram 
      amplitude?
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsaa186 [doi]
LID - zsaa186
AB  - Aging is associated with reduced slow wave (SW) density (number SW/min in 
      nonrapid-eye movement sleep) and amplitude. It has been proposed that an 
      age-related decrease in SW density may be due to a reduction in 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude instead of a decline in the capacity to 
      generate SW. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to adapt SW amplitude 
      criteria to age and sex. We predicted that the adapted criteria would reduce age 
      and sex differences in SW density and SW characteristics but would not abolish 
      them. A total of 284 healthy younger and older adults participated in one night 
      of sleep EEG recording. We defined age- and sex-adapted SW criteria in a first 
      cohort of younger (n = 97) and older (n = 110) individuals using a 
      signal-to-noise ratio approach. We then used these age- and sex-specific criteria 
      in an independent second cohort (n = 77, 38 younger and 39 older adults) to 
      evaluate age and sex differences on SW density and SW characteristics. After 
      adapting SW amplitude criteria, we showed maintenance of an age-related 
      difference for SW density whereas the sex-related difference vanished. Indeed, 
      older adults produced less SW compared with younger adults. Specifically, the 
      adapted SW amplitude criteria increased the probability of occurrence of low 
      amplitude SW (<80 µV) for older men especially. Our results thereby confirm an 
      age-related decline in SW generation rather than an artifact in the detection 
      amplitude criteria. As for the SW characteristics, the age- and sex-adapted 
      criteria display reproducible effects across the two independent cohorts 
      suggesting a more reliable inventory of the SW.

TI  - Artifact Reduction in Simultaneous EEG-fMRI: A Systematic Review of Methods and 
      Contemporary Usage.
PG  - 622719
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2021.622719 [doi]
LID - 622719
AB  - Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a technique that 
      combines temporal (largely from EEG) and spatial (largely from fMRI) indicators 
      of brain dynamics. It is useful for understanding neuronal activity during many 
      different event types, including spontaneous epileptic discharges, the activity 
      of sleep stages, and activity evoked by external stimuli and decision-making 
      tasks. However, EEG recorded during fMRI is subject to imaging, pulse, 
      environment and motion artifact, causing noise many times greater than the 
      neuronal signals of interest. Therefore, artifact removal methods are essential 
      to ensure that artifacts are accurately removed, and EEG of interest is retained. 
      This paper presents a systematic review of methods for artifact reduction in 
      simultaneous EEG-fMRI from literature published since 1998, and an additional 
      systematic review of EEG-fMRI studies published since 2016. The aim of the first 
      review is to distill the literature into clear guidelines for use of simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI artifact reduction methods, and the aim of the second review is to 
      determine the prevalence of artifact reduction method use in contemporary 
      studies. We find that there are many published artifact reduction techniques 
      available, including hardware, model based, and data-driven methods, but there 
      are few studies published that adequately compare these methods. In contrast, 
      recent EEG-fMRI studies show overwhelming use of just one or two artifact 
      reduction methods based on literature published 15-20 years ago, with newer 
      methods rarely gaining use outside the group that developed them. Surprisingly, 
      almost 15% of EEG-fMRI studies published since 2016 fail to adequately describe 
      the methods of artifact reduction utilized. We recommend minimum standards for 
      reporting artifact reduction techniques in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies and 
      suggest that more needs to be done to make new artifact reduction techniques more 
      accessible for the researchers and clinicians using simultaneous EEG-fMRI.

      Pharmacoresistant Focal Epilepsies.
PG  - 591586

AB  - Objective: The recent FDA approval of the first 7T MRI scanner for clinical 
      diagnostic use in October 2017 will likely increase the utilization of 7T for 
      epilepsy presurgical evaluation. This study aims at accessing the radiological 
      and clinical value of 7T in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy and 
      3T-visible lesions. Methods: Patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy were 
      included if they had a lesion on pre-operative standard-of-care 3T MRI and also a 
      7T research MRI. An epilepsy protocol was used for the acquisition of the 7T MRI. 
      Prospective visual analysis of 7T MRI was performed by an experienced 
      board-certified neuroradiologist and communicated to the patient management team. 
      The clinical significance of the additional 7T findings was assessed by 
      intracranial EEG (ICEEG) ictal onset, surgical resection, post-operative seizure 
      outcome and histopathology. A subset of lesions were demarked with arrows for 
      subsequent, retrospective comparison between 3T and 7T by 7 neuroradiologists 
      using a set of quantitative scales: lesion presence, conspicuity, boundary, 
      gray-white tissue contrast, artifacts, and the most helpful sequence for 
      diagnosis. Conger's kappa for multiple raters was performed for chance-adjusted 
      agreement statistics. Results: A total of 47 patients were included, with the 
      main pathology types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), hippocampal sclerosis, 
      periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), tumor and polymicrogyria (PMG). 7T 
      detected additional smaller lesions in 19% (9/47) of patients, who had extensive 
      abnormalities such as PMG and PVNH; however, these additional findings were not 
      necessarily epileptogenic. 3T-7T comparison by the neuroradiologist team showed 
      that lesion conspicuity and lesion boundary were significantly better at 7T (p < 
      0.001), particularly for FCD, PVNH and PMG. Chance-adjusted agreement was within 
      the fair range for lesion presence, conspicuity and boundary. Gray-white contrast 
      was significantly improved at 7T (p < 0.001). Significantly more artifacts were 
      encountered at 7T (p < 0.001). Significance: For patients with 3T-visible 
      lesions, 7T MRI may better elucidate the extent of multifocal abnormalities such 
      as PVNH and PMG, providing potential targets to improve ICEEG implantation. 
      Patients with FCD, PVNH and PMG would likely benefit the most from 7T due to 
      improved lesion conspicuity and boundary. Pathologies in the antero-inferior 
      temporal regions likely benefit less due to artifacts.

AB  - Brain oscillations, e.g. measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography 
      (EEG/MEG), are causally linked to brain functions that are fundamental for 
      perception, cognition and learning. Recent advances in neurotechnology provide 
      means to non-invasively target these oscillations using frequency-tuned 
      amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS). 
      However, online adaptation of stimulation parameters to ongoing brain 
      oscillations remains an unsolved problem due to stimulation artifacts that impede 
      such adaptation, particularly at the target frequency. Here, we introduce a 
      real-time compatible artifact rejection algorithm (Stimulation Artifact Source 
      Separation, SASS) that overcomes this limitation. SASS is a spatial filter 
      (linear projection) removing EEG signal components that are maximally different 
      in the presence versus absence of stimulation. This enables the reliable removal 
      of stimulation-specific signal components, while leaving physiological signal 
      components unaffected. For validation of SASS, we evoked brain activity with 
      known phase and amplitude using 10 Hz visual flickers across 7 healthy human 
      volunteers. 64-channel EEG was recorded during and in absence of 10 Hz AM-tACS 
      targeting the visual cortex. Phase differences between AM-tACS and the visual 
      stimuli were randomized, so that steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) 
      were phase-locked to the visual stimuli but not to the AM-tACS signal. For 
      validation, distributions of single-trial amplitude and phase of EEG signals 
      recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS were compared for each participant. 
      When no artifact rejection method was applied, AM-tACS stimulation artifacts 
      impeded assessment of single-trial SSVEP amplitude and phase. Using SASS, 
      amplitude and phase of single trials recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS 
      were comparable. These results indicate that SASS can be used to establish 
      adaptive (closed-loop) AM-tACS, a potentially powerful tool to target various 
      brain functions, and to investigate how AM-tACS interacts with electric brain 
      oscillations.

AB  - With prevalence of electrophysiological data collected outside of the laboratory 
      from portable, non-invasive modalities growing at a rapid rate, the quality of 
      these recorded data, if not adequate, could affect the effectiveness of medical 
      devices that depend of them. In this work, we propose novel methods to evaluate 
      electrophysiological signal quality to determine how much of the data represents 
      the physiological source of interest. Data driven models are investigated through 
      Bayesian decision and deep learning-based methods to score unimodal (signal and 
      noise recorded on same device) and multimodal (signal and noise each recorded 
      from different devices) data, respectively. We validate these methods and models 
      on three electroencephalography (EEG) data sets (N = 60 subjects) to score EEG 
      quality based on the presence of ocular artifacts with our unimodal method and 
      motion artifacts with our multimodal method. Further, we apply our unimodal 
      source method to compare the performance of two different artifact removal 
      algorithms. Our results show we are able to effectively score EEG data using both 
      methods and apply our method to evaluate the performance of other artifact 
      removal algorithms that target ocular artifacts. Methods developed and validated 
      here can be used to assess data quality and evaluate the effectiveness of certain 
      noise-reduction algorithms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most of effectiveness assessments of the widely-used Massage therapy 
      were based on subjective routine clinical assessment tools, such as Visual 
      Analogue Scale (VAS) score. However, few studies demonstrated the impact of 
      massage on the Electroencephalograph (EEG) rhythm decoding of Motor imagery (MI) 
      and motion execution (ME) with trunk left/right bending in patients with skeletal 
      muscle pain. METHOD: We used the sample entropy (SampEn), permutation entropy 
      (PermuEn), common spatial pattern (CSP) features, support vector machine (SVM) 
      and logic regression (LR) classifiers. We also used the convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) and attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) 
      for classification. RESULTS: The averaged SampEn and PermuEn values of alpha 
      rhythm decreased in almost fourteen channels for five statuses (quiet, MI with 
      left/right bending, ME with left/right bending). It indicated that massage 
      alleviates the pain for the patients of skeletal pain. Furthermore, compared with 
      the SVM and LR classifiers, the BiLSTM method achieved a better area under curve 
      (AUC) of 0.89 for the classification of MI with trunk left/right bending before 
      massage. The AUC became smaller after massage than that before massage for the 
      classification of MI with trunk left/right bending using CNN and BiLSTM methods. 
      The Permutation direct indicator (PDI) score showed the significant difference 
      for patients in different statuses (before vs after massage, and MI vs ME). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Massage not only affects the quiet status, but also affects the MI 
      and ME. Clinical Impact: Massage therapy may affect a bit on the accuracy of MI 
      with trunk left/right bending and it change the topography of MI and ME with 
      trunk left/right bending for the patients with skeletal muscle pain.

AB  - In EEG data acquired in the presence of fMRI, gradient-related spike artifacts 
      contaminate the signal following the common preprocessing step of average 
      artifact subtraction. Spike artifacts compromise EEG data quality since they 
      overlap with the EEG signal in frequency, thereby confounding frequency-based 
      inferences on activity. As well, spike artifacts can inflate or deflate 
      correlations among time series, thereby confounding inferences on functional 
      connectivity. We present Schrödinger filtering, which uses the Schrödinger 
      equation to decompose the spike-containing input. The basis functions of the 
      decomposition are localized and pulse-shaped, and selectively capture the various 
      input peaks, with the spike components clustered at the beginning of the 
      spectrum. Schrödinger filtering automatically subtracts the spike components from 
      the data. On real and simulated data, we show that Schrödinger filtering (1) 
      simultaneously accomplishes high spike removal and high signal preservation 
      without affecting evoked activity, and (2) reduces spurious pairwise correlations 
      in spontaneous activity. In these regards, Schrödinger filtering was 
      significantly better than three other despiking techniques: median filtering, 
      amplitude thresholding, and wavelet denoising. These results encourage the use of 
      Schrödinger filtering in future EEG-fMRI pipelines, as well as in other 
      spike-related applications (e.g., fMRI motion artifact removal or action 
      potential extraction).

TI  - Analysis of Human Gait Using Hybrid EEG-fNIRS-Based BCI System: A Review.
PG  - 613254

AB  - Human gait is a complex activity that requires high coordination between the 
      central nervous system, the limb, and the musculoskeletal system. More research 
      is needed to understand the latter coordination's complexity in designing better 
      and more effective rehabilitation strategies for gait disorders. 
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are 
      among the most used technologies for monitoring brain activities due to 
      portability, non-invasiveness, and relatively low cost compared to others. Fusing 
      EEG and fNIRS is a well-known and established methodology proven to enhance 
      brain-computer interface (BCI) performance in terms of classification accuracy, 
      number of control commands, and response time. Although there has been 
      significant research exploring hybrid BCI (hBCI) involving both EEG and fNIRS for 
      different types of tasks and human activities, human gait remains still 
      underinvestigated. In this article, we aim to shed light on the recent 
      development in the analysis of human gait using a hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI 
      system. The current review has followed guidelines of preferred reporting items 
      for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) during the data collection and 
      selection phase. In this review, we put a particular focus on the commonly used 
      signal processing and machine learning algorithms, as well as survey the 
      potential applications of gait analysis. We distill some of the critical findings 
      of this survey as follows. First, hardware specifications and experimental 
      paradigms should be carefully considered because of their direct impact on the 
      quality of gait assessment. Second, since both modalities, EEG and fNIRS, are 
      sensitive to motion artifacts, instrumental, and physiological noises, there is a 
      quest for more robust and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Third, 
      hybrid temporal and spatial features, obtained by virtue of fusing EEG and fNIRS 
      and associated with cortical activation, can help better identify the correlation 
      between brain activation and gait. In conclusion, hBCI (EEG + fNIRS) system is 
      not yet much explored for the lower limb due to its complexity compared to the 
      higher limb. Existing BCI systems for gait monitoring tend to only focus on one 
      modality. We foresee a vast potential in adopting hBCI in gait analysis. Imminent 
      technical breakthroughs are expected using hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI for gait to 
      control assistive devices and Monitor neuro-plasticity in neuro-rehabilitation. 
      However, although those hybrid systems perform well in a controlled experimental 
      environment when it comes to adopting them as a certified medical device in 
      real-life clinical applications, there is still a long way to go.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and 
      prognostication of many neurological ailments including seizure, coma, sleep 
      disorders, brain injury, and behavioral abnormalities. One of the primary 
      challenges of EEG data is its sensitivity to a breadth of non-stationary noises 
      caused by physiological-, movement-, and equipment-related artifacts. Existing 
      solutions to artifact detection are deficient because they require experts to 
      manually explore and annotate data for artifact segments. Existing solutions to 
      artifact correction or removal are deficient because they assume that the 
      incidence and specific characteristics of artifacts are similar across both 
      subjects and tasks (i.e., "one-size-fits-all"). In this paper, we describe a 
      novel EEG noise-reduction method that uses representation learning to perform 
      patient- and task-specific artifact detection and correction. More specifically, 
      our method extracts 58 clinically relevant features and applies an ensemble of 
      unsupervised outlier detection algorithms to identify EEG artifacts that are 
      unique to a given task and subject. The artifact segments are then passed to a 
      deep encoder-decoder network for unsupervised artifact correction. We compared 
      the performance of classification models trained with and without our method and 
      observed a 10% relative improvement in performance when using our approach. Our 
      method provides a flexible end-to-end unsupervised framework that can be applied 
      to novel EEG data without the need for expert supervision and can be used for a 
      variety of clinical decision tasks, including coma prognostication and 
      degenerative illness detection. By making our method, code, and data publicly 
      available, our work provides a tool that is of both immediate practical utility 
      and may also serve as an important foundation for future efforts in this domain.

TI  - Transcranial Evoked Potentials Can Be Reliably Recorded with Active Electrodes.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11020145 [doi]
LID - 145
AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) are usually recorded with passive electrodes (PE). Active electrode (AE) 
      systems have recently become widely available; compared to PE, they allow for 
      easier electrode preparation and a higher-quality signal, due to the 
      preamplification at the electrode stage, which reduces electrical line noise. The 
      performance between the AE and PE can differ, especially with fast EEG voltage 
      changes, which can easily occur with TMS-EEG; however, a systematic comparison in 
      the TMS-EEG setting has not been made. Therefore, we recorded TMS-evoked EEG 
      potentials (TEPs) in a group of healthy subjects in two sessions, one using PE 
      and the other using AE. We stimulated the left primary motor cortex and right 
      medial prefrontal cortex and used two different approaches to remove early TMS 
      artefacts, Independent Component Analysis and Signal Space Projection-Source 
      Informed Recovery. We assessed statistical differences in amplitude and 
      topography of TEPs, and their similarity, by means of the concordance correlation 
      coefficient (CCC). We also tested the capability of each system to approximate 
      the final TEP waveform with a reduced number of trials. The results showed that 
      TEPs recorded with AE and PE do not differ in amplitude and topography, and only 
      few electrodes showed a lower-than-expected CCC between the two methods of 
      amplification. We conclude that AE are a viable solution for TMS-EEG recording.

TI  - Real-Time Artifacts Reduction during TMS-EEG Co-Registration: A Comprehensive 
      Review on Technologies and Procedures.
LID - 10.3390/s21020637 [doi]
LID - 637
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) excites neurons in the cortex, and neural 
      activity can be simultaneously recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). 
      However, TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) do not only reflect transcranial neural 
      stimulation as they can be contaminated by artifacts. Over the last two decades, 
      significant developments in EEG amplifiers, TMS-compatible technology, customized 
      hardware and open source software have enabled researchers to develop approaches 
      which can substantially reduce TMS-induced artifacts. In TMS-EEG experiments, 
      various physiological and external occurrences have been identified and attempts 
      have been made to minimize or remove them using online techniques. Despite these 
      advances, technological issues and methodological constraints prevent 
      straightforward recordings of early TEPs components. To the best of our 
      knowledge, there is no review on both TMS-EEG artifacts and EEG technologies in 
      the literature to-date. Our survey aims to provide an overview of research 
      studies in this field over the last 40 years. We review TMS-EEG artifacts, their 
      sources and their waveforms and present the state-of-the-art in EEG technologies 
      and front-end characteristics. We also propose a synchronization toolbox for 
      TMS-EEG laboratories. We then review subject preparation frameworks and online 
      artifacts reduction maneuvers for improving data acquisition and conclude by 
      outlining open challenges and future research directions in the field.

TI  - Electromyogram (EMG) Removal by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE)-A Novel ICA-Based 
      Algorithm for Removing Myoelectric Artifacts From EEG.
PG  - 597941
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2020.597941 [doi]
LID - 597941
AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by 
      electromyographic (EMG) artifacts, especially when recording during movement. 
      Existing methods to remove EMG artifacts include independent component analysis 
      (ICA), and other high-order statistical methods. However, these methods can not 
      effectively remove most of EMG artifacts. Here, we proposed a modified ICA model 
      for EMG artifacts removal in the EEG, which is called EMG Removal by Adding 
      Sources of EMG (ERASE). In this new approach, additional channels of real EMG 
      from neck and head muscles (reference artifacts) were added as inputs to ICA in 
      order to "force" the most power from EMG artifacts into a few independent 
      components (ICs). The ICs containing EMG artifacts (the "artifact ICs") were 
      identified and rejected using an automated procedure. ERASE was validated first 
      using both simulated and experimentally-recorded EEG and EMG. Simulation results 
      showed ERASE removed EMG artifacts from EEG significantly more effectively than 
      conventional ICA. Also, it had a low false positive rate and high sensitivity. 
      Subsequently, EEG was collected from 8 healthy participants while they moved 
      their hands to test the realistic efficacy of this approach. Results showed that 
      ERASE successfully removed EMG artifacts (on average, about 75% of EMG artifacts 
      were removed when using real EMGs as reference artifacts) while preserving the 
      expected EEG features related to movement. We also tested the ERASE procedure 
      using simulated EMGs as reference artifacts (about 63% of EMG artifacts removed). 
      Compared to conventional ICA, ERASE removed on average 26% more EMG artifacts 
      from EEG. These findings suggest that ERASE can achieve significant separation of 
      EEG signal and EMG artifacts without a loss of the underlying EEG features. These 
      results indicate that using additional real or simulated EMG sources can increase 
      the effectiveness of ICA in removing EMG artifacts from EEG. Combined with 
      automated artifact IC rejection, ERASE also minimizes potential user bias. Future 
      work will focus on improving ERASE so that it can also be used in real-time 
      applications.

AB  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the nervous system has been 
      extensively used in neurorehabilitation due to its capacity to engage the muscle 
      fibers, improving muscle tone, and the neural pathways, sending afferent volleys 
      toward the brain. Although different neuroimaging tools suggested the capability 
      of NMES to regulate the excitability of sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal 
      circuits, how the intensity and dose of NMES can neuromodulate the brain 
      oscillatory activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) is still unknown 
      to date. We quantified the effect of NMES parameters on brain oscillatory 
      activity of 12 healthy participants who underwent stimulation of wrist extensors 
      during rest. Three different NMES intensities were included, two below and one 
      above the individual motor threshold, fixing the stimulation frequency to 35 Hz 
      and the pulse width to 300 μs. Firstly, we efficiently removed stimulation 
      artifacts from the EEG recordings. Secondly, we analyzed the effect of amplitude 
      and dose on the sensorimotor oscillatory activity. On the one hand, we observed a 
      significant NMES intensity-dependent modulation of brain activity, demonstrating 
      the direct effect of afferent receptor recruitment. On the other hand, we 
      described a significant NMES intensity-dependent dose-effect on sensorimotor 
      activity modulation over time, with below-motor-threshold intensities causing 
      cortical inhibition and above-motor-threshold intensities causing cortical 
      facilitation. Our results highlight the relevance of intensity and dose of NMES, 
      and show that these parameters can influence the recruitment of the sensorimotor 
      pathways from the muscle to the brain, which should be carefully considered for 
      the design of novel neuromodulation interventions based on NMES.

TI  - Measuring implanted patient response to tone pips.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s12938-020-00844-6 [doi]
LID - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: An electrical potential not previously reported-electrical cochlear 
      response (ECR)-observed only in implanted patients is described. Its amplitude 
      and growth slope are a measurement of the stimulation achieved by a tone pip on 
      the auditory nerve. The stimulation and recording system constructed for this 
      purpose, the features of this potential obtained in a group of 43 children, and 
      its possible clinical use are described. The ECR is obtained by averaging the EEG 
      epochs acquired each time the cochlear implant (CI) processes a tone pip of known 
      frequency and intensity when the patient is sleeping and using the CI in everyday 
      mode. The ECR is sensitive to tone pip intensity level, microphone sensitivity, 
      sound processor gain, dynamic range of electrical current, and responsiveness to 
      electrical current of the auditory nerve portion involved with the electrode 
      under test. It allows individual evaluation of intracochlear electrodes by 
      choosing, one at the time, the central frequency of the electrode as the test 
      tone pip frequency, so the ECR measurement due to a variable intensity tone pip 
      allows to establish the suitability of the dynamic range of the electrode 
      current. RESULTS: There is a difference in ECR measurements when patients are 
      grouped based on their auditory behavior. The ECR slope and amplitude for the 
      Sensitive group is 0.2 μV/dB(HL) and 10 μV at 50 dB(HL) compared with 
      0.04 μV/dB(HL) and 3 μV at 50dB(HL) for the Inconsistent group. The clinical 
      cases show that adjusting the dynamic range of current based on the ECR improved 
      the patient's auditory behavior. CONCLUSIONS: ECR can be recorded regardless of 
      the artifact due to the electromyographic activity of the patient and the 
      functioning of the CI. Its amplitude and growth slope versus the intensity of the 
      stimulus differs between electrodes. The relationship between minimum ECR 
      detection intensity level and auditory threshold suggests the possibility of 
      estimating patient auditory thresholds this way. ECR does not depend on the 
      subject's age, cooperation, or health status. It can be obtained at any time 
      after implant surgery and the test procedure is the same regardless of device 
      manufacturer.

TI  - Is Brain Dynamics Preserved in the EEG After Automated Artifact Removal? A 
      Validation of the Fingerprint Method and the Automatic Removal of Cardiac 
      Interference Approach Based on Microstate Analysis.
PG  - 577160

AB  - The assessment of a method for removing artifacts from electroencephalography 
      (EEG) datasets often disregard verifying that global brain dynamics is preserved. 
      In this study, we verified that the recently introduced optimized fingerprint 
      method and the automatic removal of cardiac interference (ARCI) approach not only 
      remove physiological artifacts from EEG recordings but also preserve global brain 
      dynamics, as assessed with a new approach based on microstate analysis. We 
      recorded EEG activity with a high-resolution EEG system during two resting-state 
      conditions (eyes open, 25 volunteers, and eyes closed, 26 volunteers) known to 
      exhibit different brain dynamics. After signal decomposition by independent 
      component analysis (ICA), the independent components (ICs) related to eyeblinks, 
      eye movements, myogenic interference, and cardiac electromechanical activity were 
      identified with the optimized fingerprint method and ARCI approach and 
      statistically compared with the outcome of the expert classification of the ICs 
      by visual inspection. Brain dynamics in two different groups of denoised EEG 
      signals, reconstructed after having removed the artifactual ICs identified by 
      either visual inspection or the automated methods, was assessed by calculating 
      microstate topographies, microstate metrics (duration, occurrence, and coverage), 
      and directional predominance (based on transition probabilities). No 
      statistically significant differences between the expert and the automated 
      classification of the artifactual ICs were found (p > 0.05). Cronbach's α values 
      assessed the high test-retest reliability of microstate parameters for EEG 
      datasets denoised by the automated procedure. The total EEG signal variance 
      explained by the sets of global microstate templates was about 80% for all 
      denoised EEG datasets, with no significant differences between groups. For the 
      differently denoised EEG datasets in the two recording conditions, we found that 
      the global microstate templates and the sequences of global microstates were very 
      similar (p < 0.01). Descriptive statistics and Cronbach's α of microstate metrics 
      highlighted no significant differences and excellent consistency between groups 
      (p > 0.5). These results confirm the ability of the optimized fingerprint method 
      and the ARCI approach to effectively remove physiological artifacts from EEG 
      recordings while preserving global brain dynamics. They also suggest that 
      microstate analysis could represent a novel approach for assessing the ability of 
      an EEG denoising method to remove artifacts without altering brain dynamics.

AB  - Fixation-related potentials (FRPs), neural responses aligned to the end of 
      saccades, are a promising tool for studying the dynamics of attention and 
      cognition under natural viewing conditions. In the past, four methodological 
      problems have complicated the analysis of such combined 
      eye-tracking/electroencephalogram experiments: (1) the synchronization of data 
      streams, (2) the removal of ocular artifacts, (3) the condition-specific temporal 
      overlap between the brain responses evoked by consecutive fixations, and (4) the 
      fact that numerous low-level stimulus and saccade properties also influence the 
      postsaccadic neural responses. Although effective solutions exist for the first 
      two problems, the latter two are only beginning to be addressed. In the current 
      paper, we present and review a unified regression-based framework for FRP 
      analysis that allows us to deconvolve overlapping potentials while also 
      controlling for both linear and nonlinear confounds on the FRP waveform. An open 
      software implementation is provided for all procedures. We then demonstrate the 
      advantages of this proposed (non)linear deconvolution modeling approach for data 
      from three commonly studied paradigms: face perception, scene viewing, and 
      reading. First, for a traditional event-related potential (ERP) face recognition 
      experiment, we show how this technique can separate stimulus ERPs from 
      overlapping muscle and brain potentials produced by small (micro)saccades on the 
      face. Second, in natural scene viewing, we model and isolate multiple nonlinear 
      effects of saccade parameters on the FRP. Finally, for a natural sentence reading 
      experiment using the boundary paradigm, we show how it is possible to study the 
      neural correlates of parafoveal preview after removing spurious overlap effects 
      caused by the associated difference in average fixation time. Our results suggest 
      a principal way of measuring reliable eye movement-related brain activity during 
      natural vision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The methods available for pre-processing EEG data are rapidly 
      evolving as researchers gain access to vast computational resources; however, the 
      field currently lacks a set of standardized approaches for data characterization, 
      efficient interactive quality control review procedures, and large-scale 
      automated processing that is compatible with High Performance Computing (HPC) 
      resources. NEW METHOD: In this paper we describe an infrastructure for the 
      development of standardized procedures for semi and fully automated 
      pre-processing of EEG data. Our pipeline incorporates several methods to isolate 
      cortical signal from noise, maintain maximal information from raw recordings and 
      provide comprehensive quality control and data visualization. In addition, batch 
      processing procedures are integrated to scale up analyses for processing hundreds 
      or thousands of data sets using HPC clusters. RESULTS: We demonstrate here that 
      by using the EEG Integrated Platform Lossless (EEG-IP-L) pipeline's signal 
      quality annotations, significant increase in data retention is achieved when 
      applying subsequent post-processing ERP segment rejection procedures. Further, we 
      demonstrate that the increase in data retention does not attenuate the ERP 
      signal. CONCLUSIONS: The EEG-IP-L state provides the infrastructure for an 
      integrated platform that includes long-term data storage, minimal data 
      manipulation and maximal signal retention, and flexibility in post processing 
      strategies.

TI  - Ballistocardiogram Artifact Reduction in Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Using Deep 
      Learning.
PG  - 78-89
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2020.3004548 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The concurrent recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that has received 
      much attention due to its potential for combined high temporal and spatial 
      resolution. However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG), a large-amplitude artifact 
      caused by cardiac induced movement contaminates the EEG during EEG-fMRI 
      recordings. Removal of BCG in software has generally made use of linear 
      decompositions of the corrupted EEG. This is not ideal as the BCG signal 
      propagates in a manner which is non-linearly dependent on the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG). In this paper, we present a novel method for BCG artifact suppression 
      using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). METHODS: EEG signals were recovered by 
      training RNNs on the nonlinear mappings between ECG and the BCG corrupted EEG. We 
      evaluated our model's performance against the commonly used Optimal Basis Set 
      (OBS) method at the level of individual subjects, and investigated generalization 
      across subjects. RESULTS: We show that our algorithm can generate larger average 
      power reduction of the BCG at critical frequencies, while simultaneously 
      improving task relevant EEG based classification. CONCLUSION: The presented deep 
      learning architecture can be used to reduce BCG related artifacts in EEG-fMRI 
      recordings. SIGNIFICANCE: We present a deep learning approach that can be used to 
      suppress the BCG artifact in EEG-fMRI without the use of additional hardware. 
      This method may have scope to be combined with current hardware methods, operate 
      in real-time and be used for direct modeling of the BCG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of 
      premature death in patients with epilepsy. If timely assessment of SUDEP risk can 
      be made, early interventions for optimized treatments might be provided. One of 
      the biomarkers being investigated for SUDEP risk assessment is postictal 
      generalized EEG suppression [postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES)]. For 
      example, prolonged PGES has been found to be associated with a higher risk for 
      SUDEP. Accurate characterization of PGES requires correct identification of the 
      end of PGES, which is often complicated due to signal noise and artifacts, and 
      has been reported to be a difficult task even for trained clinical professionals. 
      In this work we present a method for automatic detection of the end of PGES using 
      multi-channel EEG recordings, thus enabling the downstream task of SUDEP risk 
      assessment by PGES characterization. METHODS: We address the detection of the end 
      of PGES as a classification problem. Given a short EEG snippet, a trained model 
      classifies whether it consists of the end of PGES or not. Scalp EEG recordings 
      from a total of 134 patients with epilepsy are used for training a random forest 
      based classification model. Various time-series based features are used to 
      characterize the EEG signal for the classification task. The features that we 
      have used are computationally inexpensive, making it suitable for real-time 
      implementations and low-power solutions. The reference labels for classification 
      are based on annotations by trained clinicians identifying the end of PGES in an 
      EEG recording. RESULTS: We evaluated our classification model on an independent 
      test dataset from 34 epileptic patients and obtained an AUreceiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) (area under the curve) of 0.84. We found that inclusion of 
      multiple EEG channels is important for better classification results, possibly 
      owing to the generalized nature of PGES. Of among the channels included in our 
      analysis, the central EEG channels were found to provide the best discriminative 
      representation for the detection of the end of PGES. CONCLUSION: Accurate 
      detection of the end of PGES is important for PGES characterization and SUDEP 
      risk assessment. In this work, we showed that it is feasible to automatically 
      detect the end of PGES-otherwise difficult to detect due to EEG noise and 
      artifacts-using time-series features derived from multi-channel EEG recordings. 
      In future work, we will explore deep learning based models for improved detection 
      and investigate the downstream task of PGES characterization for SUDEP risk 
      assessment.

      Representation of Event-Related Potentials.
PG  - 8841354

AB  - Evoked event-related oscillations (EROs) have been widely used to explore the 
      mechanisms of brain activities for both normal people and neuropsychiatric 
      disease patients. In most previous studies, the calculation of the regions of 
      evoked EROs of interest is commonly based on a predefined time window and a 
      frequency range given by the experimenter, which tends to be subjective. 
      Additionally, evoked EROs sometimes cannot be fully extracted using the 
      conventional time-frequency analysis (TFA) because they may be overlapped with 
      each other or with artifacts in time, frequency, and space domains. To further 
      investigate the related neuronal processes, a novel approach was proposed 
      including three steps: (1) extract the temporal and spatial components of 
      interest simultaneously by temporal principal component analysis (PCA) and Promax 
      rotation and project them to the electrode fields for correcting their variance 
      and polarity indeterminacies, (2) calculate the time-frequency representations 
      (TFRs) of the back-projected components, and (3) compute the regions of evoked 
      EROs of interest on TFRs objectively using the edge detection algorithm. We 
      performed this novel approach, conventional TFA, and TFA-PCA to analyse both the 
      synthetic datasets with different levels of SNR and an actual ERP dataset in a 
      two-factor paradigm of waiting time (short/long) and feedback (loss/gain) 
      separately. Synthetic datasets results indicated that N2-theta and P3-delta 
      oscillations can be stably detected from different SNR-simulated datasets using 
      the proposed approach, but, by comparison, only one oscillation was obtained via 
      the last two approaches. Furthermore, regarding the actual dataset, the 
      statistical results for the proposed approach revealed that P3-delta was 
      sensitive to the waiting time but not for that of the other approaches. This 
      study manifested that the proposed approach could objectively extract evoked EROs 
      of interest, which allows a better understanding of the modulations of the 
      oscillatory responses.

PG  - 536070

LID - 536070
AB  - BACKGROUND: To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial 
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific 
      tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency 
      in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly 
      limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent 
      tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure 
      that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved. The 
      current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of specific artifact correction 
      techniques to clean tACS-contaminated EEG data. NEW METHOD: In the first 
      experiment, we used a phantom head to have full control over the signal to be 
      analyzed. Driving pre-recorded human brain-oscillation signals through a dipolar 
      current source within the phantom, we simultaneously applied tACS and compared 
      the performance of different artifact-correction techniques: sine subtraction, 
      template subtraction, and signal-space projection (SSP). In the second 
      experiment, we combined tACS and EEG on one human subject to demonstrate the 
      best-performing data-correction approach in a proof of principle. RESULTS: The 
      tACS artifact was highly attenuated by SSP in the phantom and the human EEG; 
      thus, we were able to recover the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory 
      activity. In the human experiment, event-related desynchronization could be 
      restored after correcting the artifact. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The 
      best results were achieved with SSP, which outperformed sine subtraction and 
      template subtraction. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SSP 
      by applying it to a phantom measurement with pre-recorded signal and one human 
      tACS + EEG dataset. For a full validation of SSP, more data are needed.

TI  - Backward Walking Induces Significantly Larger Upper-Mu-Rhythm Suppression Effects 
      Than Forward Walking Does.
LID - 10.3390/s20247250 [doi]
LID - 7250
AB  - Studies have compared the differences and similarities between backward walking 
      and forward walking, and demonstrated the potential of backward walking for gait 
      rehabilitation. However, current evidence supporting the benefits of backward 
      walking over forward walking remains inconclusive. Considering the proven 
      association between gait and the cerebral cortex, we used electroencephalograms 
      (EEG) to differentiate the effects of backward walking and forward walking on 
      cortical activities, by comparing the sensorimotor rhythm (8-12 Hz, also called 
      mu rhythm) of EEG signals. A systematic signal procedure was used to eliminate 
      the motion artifacts induced by walking to safeguard EEG signal fidelity. 
      Statistical test results of our experimental data demonstrated that walking 
      motions significantly suppressed mu rhythm. Moreover, backward walking exhibited 
      significantly larger upper mu rhythm (10-12 Hz) suppression effects than forward 
      walking did. This finding implies that backward walking induces more sensorimotor 
      cortex activity than forward walking does, and provides a basis to support the 
      potential benefits of backward walking over forward walking. By monitoring the 
      upper mu rhythm throughout the rehabilitation process, medical experts can 
      adaptively adjust the intensity and duration of each walking training session to 
      improve the efficacy of a walking ability recovery program.

AB  - Magneto-/Electro-encephalography (M/EEG) commonly uses (fast) Fourier 
      transformation to compute power spectral density (PSD). However, the resulting 
      PSD plot lacks temporal information, making interpretation sometimes equivocal. 
      For example, consider two different PSDs: a central parietal EEG PSD with twin 
      peaks at 10 Hz and 20 Hz and a central parietal PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 
      50 Hz. We can assume the first PSD shows a mu rhythm and the second harmonic; 
      however, the latter PSD likely shows an alpha peak and an independent line noise. 
      Without prior knowledge, however, the PSD alone cannot distinguish between the 
      two cases. To address this limitation of PSD, we propose using cross-frequency 
      power-power coupling (PPC) as a post-processing of independent component (IC) 
      analysis (ICA) to distinguish brain components from muscle and environmental 
      artifact sources. We conclude that post-ICA PPC analysis could serve as a new 
      data-driven EEG classifier in M/EEG studies. For the reader's convenience, we 
      offer a brief literature overview on the disparate use of PPC. The proposed 
      cross-frequency power-power coupling analysis toolbox (PowPowCAT) is a free, 
      open-source toolbox, which works as an EEGLAB extension.

TI  - Applications of EEG indices for the quantification of human cognitive 
      performance: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis.
PG  - e0242857

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroergonomics combines neuroscience with ergonomics to study human 
      performance using recorded brain signals. Such neural signatures of performance 
      can be measured using a variety of neuroimaging techniques, including functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), 
      and electroencephalography (EEG). EEG has an excellent temporal resolution, and 
      EEG indices are highly sensitive to human brain activity fluctuations. OBJECTIVE: 
      The focus of this systematic review was to explore the applications of EEG 
      indices for quantifying human performance in a variety of cognitive tasks at the 
      macro and micro scales. To identify trends and the state of the field, we 
      examined global patterns among selected articles, such as journal contributions, 
      highly cited papers, affiliations, and high-frequency keywords. Moreover, we 
      discussed the most frequently used EEG indices and synthesized current knowledge 
      regarding the EEG signatures of associated human performance measurements. 
      METHODS: In this systematic review, we analyzed articles published in English 
      (from peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and conference papers), Ph.D. 
      dissertations, textbooks, and reference books. All articles reviewed herein 
      included exclusively EEG-based experimental studies in healthy participants. We 
      searched Web-of-Science and Scopus databases using specific sets of keywords. 
      RESULTS: Out of 143 papers, a considerable number of cognitive studies focused on 
      quantifying human performance with respect to mental fatigue, mental workload, 
      mental effort, visual fatigue, emotion, and stress. An increasing trend for 
      publication in this area was observed, with the highest number of publications in 
      2017. Most studies applied linear methods (e.g., EEG power spectral density and 
      the amplitude of event-related potentials) to evaluate human cognitive 
      performance. A few papers utilized nonlinear methods, such as fractal dimension, 
      largest Lyapunov exponent, and signal entropy. More than 50% of the studies 
      focused on evaluating an individual's mental states while operating a vehicle. 
      Several different methods of artifact removal have also been noted. Based on the 
      reviewed articles, research gaps, trends, and potential directions for future 
      research were explored. CONCLUSION: This systematic review synthesized current 
      knowledge regarding the application of EEG indices for quantifying human 
      performance in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. This knowledge is useful for 
      understanding the global patterns of applications of EEG indices for the analysis 
      and design of cognitive tasks.

TI  - Human myoelectric spatial patterns differ among lower limb muscles and locomotion 
      speeds.
PG  - e14652
LID - 10.14814/phy2.14652 [doi]
LID - e14652
AB  - The spatial distribution of myoelectric activity within lower limb muscles is 
      often nonuniform and can change during different stationary tasks. Recent studies 
      using high-density electromyography (EMG) have suggested that spatial muscle 
      activity may also differ among muscles during locomotion, but contrasting 
      electrode array sizes and experimental designs have limited cross-study 
      comparisons. Here, we sought to determine if spatial EMG patterns differ among 
      lower limb muscles and locomotion speeds. We recorded high-density EMG from the 
      vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and 
      lateral gastrocnemius muscles of 11 healthy subjects while they walked (1.2 and 
      1.6 m/s) and ran (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 m/s) on a treadmill. To overcome the 
      detrimental effects of cable, electrode, and soft tissue movements on 
      high-density EMG signal quality during locomotion, we applied multivariate signal 
      cleaning methods. From these data, we computed the spatial entropy and center of 
      gravity from the total myoelectric activity within each recording array during 
      the stance or swing phases of the gait cycle. We found heterogeneous spatial EMG 
      patterns evidenced by contrasting spatial entropy among lower limb muscles. As 
      locomotion speed increased, mean entropy values decreased in four of the five 
      recorded muscles, indicating that EMG signal amplitudes were more spatially 
      heterogeneous, or localized, at faster speeds. The EMG center of gravity location 
      also shifted in multiple muscles as locomotion speed increased. Contrasting 
      myoelectric spatial distributions among muscles likely reflect differences in 
      muscle architecture, but increasingly localized activity and spatial shifts in 
      the center of gravity location at faster locomotion speeds could be influenced by 
      preferential recruitment of faster motor units under greater loads.

TI  - High-density Electric Source Imaging of interictal epileptic discharges: How many 
      electrodes and which time point?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of caudal EEG electrodes over cheeks and neck for 
      high-density electric source imaging (ESI) in presurgical epilepsy evaluation, 
      and to identify the best time point during averaged interictal epileptic 
      discharges (IEDs) for optimal ESI accuracy. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 
      presurgical 257-channel EEG recordings of 45 patients with pharmacoresistant 
      focal epilepsy. By stepwise removal of cheek and neck electrodes, averaged IEDs 
      were downsampled to 219, 204, and 156 EEG channels. Additionally, ESI at the 
      IED's half-rise was compared to other time points. The respective sources of 
      maximum activity were compared to the resected brain area and postsurgical 
      outcome. RESULTS: Caudal channels had disproportionately more artefacts. In 30 
      patients with favourable outcome, the 204-channel array yielded the most accurate 
      results with ESI maxima < 10 mm from the resection in 67% and inside affected 
      sublobes in 83%. Neither in temporal nor in extratemporal cases did the full 
      257-channel setup improve ESI accuracy. ESI was most accurate at 50% of the IED's 
      rising phase. CONCLUSION: Information from cheeks and neck electrodes did not 
      improve high-density ESI accuracy, probably due to higher artefact load and 
      suboptimal biophysical modelling. SIGNIFICANCE: Very caudal EEG electrodes should 
      be used for ESI with caution.

TI  - Refinement of High-Gamma EEG Features From TBI Patients With Hemicraniectomy 
      Using an ICA Informed by Simulated Myoelectric Artifacts.
PG  - 599010

AB  - Recent studies have shown the ability to record high-γ signals (80-160 Hz) in 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients who have 
      had hemicraniectomies. However, extraction of the movement-related high-γ remains 
      challenging due to a confounding bandwidth overlap with surface electromyogram 
      (EMG) artifacts related to facial and head movements. In our previous work, we 
      described an augmented independent component analysis (ICA) approach for removal 
      of EMG artifacts from EEG, and referred to as EMG Reduction by Adding Sources of 
      EMG (ERASE). Here, we tested this algorithm on EEG recorded from six TBI patients 
      with hemicraniectomies while they performed a thumb flexion task. ERASE removed a 
      mean of 52 ± 12% (mean ± S.E.M) (maximum 73%) of EMG artifacts. In contrast, 
      conventional ICA removed a mean of 27 ± 19% (mean ± S.E.M) of EMG artifacts from 
      EEG. In particular, high-γ synchronization was significantly improved in the 
      contralateral hand motor cortex area within the hemicraniectomy site after ERASE 
      was applied. A more sophisticated measure of high-γ complexity is the fractal 
      dimension (FD). Here, we computed the FD of EEG high-γ on each channel. Relative 
      FD of high-γ was defined as that the FD in move state was subtracted by FD in 
      idle state. We found relative FD of high-γ over hemicraniectomy after applying 
      ERASE were strongly correlated to the amplitude of finger flexion force. Results 
      showed that significant correlation coefficients across the electrodes related to 
      thumb flexion averaged ~0.76, while the coefficients across the homologous 
      electrodes in non-hemicraniectomy areas were nearly 0. After conventional ICA, a 
      correlation between relative FD of high-γ and force remained high in both 
      hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.86) and non-hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.81). 
      Across all subjects, an average of 83% of electrodes significantly correlated 
      with force was located in the hemicraniectomy areas after applying ERASE. After 
      conventional ICA, only 19% of electrodes with significant correlations were 
      located in the hemicraniectomy. These results indicated that the new approach 
      isolated electrophysiological features during finger motor activation while 
      selectively removing confounding EMG artifacts. This approach removed EMG 
      artifacts that can contaminate high-gamma activity recorded over the 
      hemicraniectomy.

TI  - Differences in Power Spectral Densities and Phase Quantities Due to Processing of 
      EEG Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s20216285 [doi]
LID - 6285
AB  - There has been a growing interest in computational electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      signal processing in a diverse set of domains, such as cortical excitability 
      analysis, event-related synchronization, or desynchronization analysis. In recent 
      years, several inconsistencies were found across different EEG studies, which 
      authors often attributed to methodological differences. However, the assessment 
      of such discrepancies is deeply underexplored. It is currently unknown if 
      methodological differences can fully explain emerging differences and the nature 
      of these differences. This study aims to contrast widely used methodological 
      approaches in EEG processing and compare their effects on the outcome variables. 
      To this end, two publicly available datasets were collected, each having unique 
      traits so as to validate the results in two different EEG territories. The first 
      dataset included signals with event-related potentials (visual stimulation) from 
      45 subjects. The second dataset included resting state EEG signals from 16 
      subjects. Five EEG processing steps, involved in the computation of power and 
      phase quantities of EEG frequency bands, were explored in this study: artifact 
      removal choices (with and without artifact removal), EEG signal transformation 
      choices (raw EEG channels, Hjorth transformed channels, and averaged channels 
      across primary motor cortex), filtering algorithms (Butterworth filter and 
      Blackman-Harris window), EEG time window choices (-750 ms to 0 ms and -250 ms to 
      0 ms), and power spectral density (PSD) estimation algorithms (Welch's method, 
      Fast Fourier Transform, and Burg's method). Powers and phases estimated by 
      carrying out variations of these five methods were analyzed statistically for all 
      subjects. The results indicated that the choices in EEG transformation and 
      time-window can strongly affect the PSD quantities in a variety of ways. 
      Additionally, EEG transformation and filter choices can influence phase 
      quantities significantly. These results raise the need for a consistent and 
      standard EEG processing pipeline for computational EEG studies. Consistency of 
      signal processing methods cannot only help produce comparable results and 
      reproducible research, but also pave the way for federated machine learning 
      methods, e.g., where model parameters rather than data are shared.

AB  - Advances in EEG filtering algorithms enable analysis of EEG recorded during motor 
      tasks. Although methods such as artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) can remove 
      transient artifacts automatically, there is virtually no knowledge about how the 
      vigor of bodily movements affects ASRs performance and optimal cut-off parameter 
      selection process. We compared the ratios of removed and reconstructed EEG 
      recorded during a cognitive task, single-leg stance, and fast walking using ASR 
      with 10 cut-off parameters versus visual inspection. Furthermore, we used the 
      repeatability and dipolarity of independent components to assess their quality 
      and an automatic classification tool to assess the number of brain-related 
      independent components. The cut-off parameter equivalent to the ratio of EEG 
      removed in manual cleaning was strictest for the walking task. The quality index 
      of independent components, calculated using RELICA, reached a maximum plateau for 
      cut-off parameters of 10 and higher across all tasks while dipolarity was largely 
      unaffected. The number of independent components within each task remained 
      constant, regardless of the cut-off parameter used. Surprisingly, ASR performed 
      better in motor tasks compared with non-movement tasks. The quality index seemed 
      to be more sensitive to changes induced by ASR compared to dipolarity. There was 
      no benefit of using cut-off parameters less than 10. Graphical abstract The 
      graphical abstract shows the three tasks performed during EEG recording, the two 
      processing pipelines (manual and artifact subspace reconstruction), and the 
      metrics the conclusion is based on.

TI  - Association of fast ripples on intracranial EEG and outcomes after epilepsy 
      surgery.
PG  - e2235-e2245
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010468 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether fast ripples (FRs) are an accurate marker of the 
      epileptogenic zone, we analyzed overnight stereo-EEG recordings from 43 patients 
      and hypothesized that FR resection ratio, maximal FR rate, and FR distribution 
      predict postsurgical seizure outcome. METHODS: We detected FRs automatically from 
      an overnight recording edited for artifacts and visually from a 5-minute period 
      of slow-wave sleep. We examined primarily the accuracy of removing ≥50% of total 
      FR events or of channels with FRs to predict postsurgical seizure outcome (Engel 
      class I = good, classes II-IV = poor) according to the whole-night and 5-minute 
      analysis approaches. Secondarily, we examined the association of low overall FR 
      rates or absence or incomplete resection of 1 dominant FR area with poor outcome. 
      RESULTS: The accuracy of outcome prediction was highest (81%, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 67%-92%) with the use of the FR event resection ratio and 
      whole-night recording (vs 72%, 95% CI 56%-85%, for the visual 5-minute approach). 
      Absence of channels with FR rates >6/min (p = 0.001) and absence or incomplete 
      resection of 1 dominant FR area (p < 0.001) were associated with poor outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: FRs are accurate in predicting epilepsy surgery outcome at the 
      individual level when overnight recordings are used. Absence of channels with 
      high FR rates or absence of 1 dominant FR area is a poor prognostic factor that 
      may reflect suboptimal spatial sampling of the epileptogenic zone or 
      multifocality, rather than an inherently low sensitivity of FRs. CLASSIFICATION 
      OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that FRs are accurate in 
      predicting epilepsy surgery outcome.

AB  - Background: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have attracted great interest 
      among neuroscientists and epileptologists in recent years. Not only has their 
      occurrence been linked to epileptogenesis, but also to physiologic processes, 
      such as memory consolidation. There are at least two big challenges for HFO 
      research. First, detection, when performed manually, is time consuming and prone 
      to rater biases, but when performed automatically, it is biased by artifacts 
      mimicking HFOs. Second, distinguishing physiologic from pathologic HFOs in 
      patients with epilepsy is problematic. Here we automatically and manually 
      detected HFOs in intracranial EEGs (iEEG) of patients with epilepsy, recorded 
      during a visual memory task in order to assess the feasibility of the different 
      detection approaches to identify task-related ripples, supporting the physiologic 
      nature of HFOs in the temporal lobe. Methods: Ten patients with unclear seizure 
      origin and bilaterally implanted macroelectrodes took part in a visual memory 
      consolidation task. In addition to iEEG, scalp EEG, electrooculography (EOG), and 
      facial electromyography (EMG) were recorded. iEEG channels contralateral to the 
      suspected epileptogenic zone were inspected visually for HFOs. Furthermore, HFOs 
      were marked automatically using an RMS detector and a Stockwell classifier. We 
      compared the two detection approaches and assessed a possible link between task 
      performance and HFO occurrence during encoding and retrieval trials. Results: HFO 
      occurrence rates were significantly lower when events were marked manually. The 
      automatic detection algorithm was greatly biased by filter-artifacts. 
      Surprisingly, EOG artifacts as seen on scalp electrodes appeared to be linked to 
      many HFOs in the iEEG. Occurrence rates could not be associated to memory 
      performance, and we were not able to detect strictly defined "clear" ripples. 
      Conclusion: Filtered graphoelements in the EEG are known to mimic HFOs and thus 
      constitute a problem. So far, in invasive EEG recordings mostly technical 
      artifacts and filtered epileptiform discharges have been considered as sources 
      for these "false" HFOs. The data at hand suggests that even ocular artifacts 
      might bias automatic detection in invasive recordings. Strict guidelines and 
      standards for HFO detection are necessary in order to identify artifact-derived 
      HFOs, especially in conditions when cognitive tasks might produce a high amount 
      of artifacts.

AB  - The data obtained as a result of an EEG measurement are burdened with 
      inaccuracies related to the measurement process itself and the need to remove 
      recorded disturbances. The article presents an example of how to calculate the 
      Approach-Withdraw Index (EEG-AW) and Memorization Index (MI) indices in such a 
      way that their inaccuracy resulting from the removal of artifacts can be 
      periodically calculated. This inaccuracy is expressed in terms of standard 
      deviation. This allows you to determine the reliability of the obtained 
      conclusions in the context of examining elements in a 2D computer game created in 
      the Unity engine.

AB  - This paper focuses on a thorough summary of vital function measuring methods in 
      vehicles. The focus of this paper is to summarize and compare already existing 
      methods integrated into car seats with the implementation of inter alia 
      capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG), mechanical motion analysis 
      Ballistocardiography (BCG) and Seismocardiography (SCG). In addition, a 
      comprehensive overview of other methods of vital sign monitoring, such as 
      camera-based systems or steering wheel sensors, is also presented in this 
      article. Furthermore, this work contains a very thorough background study on 
      advanced signal processing methods and their potential application for the 
      purpose of vital sign monitoring in cars, which is prone to various disturbances 
      and artifacts occurrence that have to be eliminated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In long-term video-monitoring, automatic seizure detection holds great 
      promise as a means to reduce the workload of the epileptologist. A convolutional 
      neural network (CNN) designed to process images of EEG plots demonstrated high 
      performance for seizure detection, but still has room for reducing the 
      false-positive alarm rate. METHODS: We combined a CNN that processed images of 
      EEG plots with patient-specific autoencoders (AE) of EEG signals to reduce the 
      false alarms during seizure detection. The AE automatically logged abnormalities, 
      i.e., both seizures and artifacts. Based on seizure logs compiled by expert 
      epileptologists and errors made by AE, we constructed a CNN with 3 output 
      classes: seizure, non-seizure-but-abnormal, and non-seizure. The accumulative 
      measure of number of consecutive seizure labels was used to issue a seizure 
      alarm. RESULTS: The second-by-second classification performance of AE-CNN was 
      comparable to that of the original CNN. False-positive seizure labels in AE-CNN 
      were more likely interleaved with "non-seizure-but-abnormal" labels than with 
      true-positive seizure labels. Consequently, "non-seizure-but-abnormal" labels 
      interrupted runs of false-positive seizure labels before triggering an alarm. The 
      median false alarm rate with the AE-CNN was reduced to 0.034 h(-1), which was 
      one-fifth of that of the original CNN (0.17 h(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: A label of 
      "non-seizure-but-abnormal" offers practical benefits for seizure detection. The 
      modification of a CNN with an AE is worth considering because AEs can 
      automatically assign "non-seizure-but-abnormal" labels in an unsupervised manner 
      with no additional demands on the time of the epileptologist.

TI  - Exploring the Limitations of Event-Related Potential Measures in Moving Subjects: 
      Pilot Studies of Four Different Technical Modifications in Ergometer Rowing.
LID - 10.3390/s20195618 [doi]
LID - 5618
AB  - Measuring brain activity in moving subjects is of great importance for 
      investigating human behavior in ecological settings. For this purpose, EEG 
      measures are applicable; however, technical modifications are required to reduce 
      the typical massive movement artefacts. Four different approaches to measure 
      EEG/ERPs during rowing were tested: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted 
      preamplifier, (ii) a laboratory system with active electrodes, and a wireless 
      headset combined with (iii) passive or (iv) active electrodes. A standard visual 
      oddball task revealed very similar (within subjects) visual evoked potentials for 
      rowing and rest (without movement). The small intraindividual differences between 
      rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger interindividual 
      differences in the ERP waveforms, revealed that ERPs can be measured reliably 
      even in an athletic movement such as rowing. On the other hand, the expected 
      modulation of the motor-related activity by force output was largely affected by 
      movement artefacts. Therefore, for a successful application of ERP measures in 
      movement research, further developments to differentiate between movement-related 
      neuronal activity and movement-related artefacts are required. However, 
      activities with small magnitudes related to motor learning and motor control may 
      be difficult to detect because they are superimposed by the very large motor 
      potential, which increases with force output.

AB  - EEG is a widely used tool to study the infant brain and its relationship with 
      behavior. As infants usually have small attention spans, move at free will, and 
      do not respond to task instructions, attrition rates are usually high. Increasing 
      our understanding of what influences data loss is therefore vital. The current 
      paper examines external factors to data loss in a large-scale on-going 
      longitudinal study (the YOUth project; 1279 five-month-olds, 1024 
      ten-months-olds, and 109 three-year-olds). Data loss is measured for both 
      continuous EEG and ERP tasks as the percentage data loss after artifact removal. 
      Our results point to a wide array of external factors that contribute to data 
      loss, some related to the child (e.g., gender; age; head shape) and some related 
      to experimental settings (e.g., choice of research assistant; time of day; 
      season; and course of the experiment). Data loss was also more pronounced in the 
      ERP experiment than in the EEG experiment. Finally, evidence was found for 
      within-subject stability in data loss characteristics over multiple sessions. We 
      end with recommendations to limit data loss in future studies.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a massive push towards reproducible research in 
      neuroscience. Unfortunately, this endeavor is often challenged by the large 
      diversity of tools used, project-specific custom code and the difficulty to track 
      all user-defined parameters. NeuroPycon is an open-source multi-modal brain data 
      analysis toolkit which provides Python-based template pipelines for advanced 
      multi-processing of MEG, EEG, functional and anatomical MRI data, with a focus on 
      connectivity and graph theoretical analyses. Importantly, it provides shareable 
      parameter files to facilitate replication of all analysis steps. NeuroPycon is 
      based on the NiPype framework which facilitates data analyses by wrapping many 
      commonly-used neuroimaging software tools into a common Python environment. In 
      other words, rather than being a brain imaging software with is own 
      implementation of standard algorithms for brain signal processing, NeuroPycon 
      seamlessly integrates existing packages (coded in python, Matlab or other 
      languages) into a unified python framework. Importantly, thanks to the 
      multi-threaded processing and computational efficiency afforded by NiPype, 
      NeuroPycon provides an easy option for fast parallel processing, which critical 
      when handling large sets of multi-dimensional brain data. Moreover, its flexible 
      design allows users to easily configure analysis pipelines by connecting distinct 
      nodes to each other. Each node can be a Python-wrapped module, a user-defined 
      function or a well-established tool (e.g. MNE-Python for MEG analysis, Radatools 
      for graph theoretical metrics, etc.). Last but not least, the ability to use 
      NeuroPycon parameter files to fully describe any pipeline is an important feature 
      for reproducibility, as they can be shared and used for easy replication by 
      others. The current implementation of NeuroPycon contains two complementary 
      packages: The first, called ephypype, includes pipelines for electrophysiology 
      analysis and a command-line interface for on the fly pipeline creation. Current 
      implementations allow for MEG/EEG data import, pre-processing and cleaning by 
      automatic removal of ocular and cardiac artefacts, in addition to sensor or 
      source-level connectivity analyses. The second package, called graphpype, is 
      designed to investigate functional connectivity via a wide range of 
      graph-theoretical metrics, including modular partitions. The present article 
      describes the philosophy, architecture, and functionalities of the toolkit and 
      provides illustrative examples through interactive notebooks. NeuroPycon is 
      available for download via github (https://github.com/neuropycon) and the two 
      principal packages are documented online 
      (https://neuropycon.github.io/ephypype/index.html, and 
      https://neuropycon.github.io/graphpype/index.html). Future developments include 
      fusion of multi-modal data (eg. MEG and fMRI or intracranial EEG and fMRI). We 
      hope that the release of NeuroPycon will attract many users and new contributors, 
      and facilitate the efforts of our community towards open source tool sharing and 
      development, as well as scientific reproducibility.

TI  - Electrophysiological assessment of temporal envelope processing in cochlear 
      implant users.
PG  - 15406

LID - 15406
AB  - Cochlear-implant (CI) users rely on temporal envelope modulations (TEMs) to 
      understand speech, and clinical outcomes depend on the accuracy with which these 
      TEMs are encoded by the electrically-stimulated neural ensembles. Non-invasive 
      EEG measures of this encoding could help clinicians identify and disable 
      electrodes that evoke poor neural responses so as to improve CI outcomes. 
      However, recording EEG during CI stimulation reveals huge stimulation artifacts 
      that are up to orders of magnitude larger than the neural response. Here we used 
      a custom-built EEG system having an exceptionally high sample rate to accurately 
      measure the artefact, which we then removed using linear interpolation so as to 
      reveal the neural response during continuous electrical stimulation. In ten adult 
      CI users, we measured the 40-Hz electrically evoked auditory steady-state 
      response (eASSR) and electrically evoked auditory change complex (eACC) to 
      amplitude-modulated 900-pulses-per-second pulse trains, stimulated in monopolar 
      mode (i.e. the clinical default), and at different modulation depths. We 
      successfully measured artifact-free 40-Hz eASSRs and eACCs. Moreover, we found 
      that the 40-Hz eASSR, in contrast to the eACC, showed substantial responses even 
      at shallow modulation depths. We argue that the 40-Hz eASSR is a clinically 
      feasible objective measure to assess TEM encoding in CI users.

AB  - Neuromarketing has become an academic and commercial area of interest, as the 
      advancements in neural recording techniques and interpreting algorithms have made 
      it an effective tool for recognizing the unspoken response of consumers to the 
      marketing stimuli. This article presents the very first systematic review of the 
      technological advancements in Neuromarketing field over the last 5 years. For 
      this purpose, authors have selected and reviewed a total of 57 relevant 
      literatures from valid databases which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing 
      field with basic or empirical research findings. This review finds consumer goods 
      as the prevalent marketing stimuli used in both product and promotion forms in 
      these selected literatures. A trend of analyzing frontal and prefrontal alpha 
      band signals is observed among the consumer emotion recognition-based 
      experiments, which corresponds to frontal alpha asymmetry theory. The use of 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) is found favorable by many researchers over functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in video advertisement-based Neuromarketing 
      experiments, apparently due to its low cost and high time resolution advantages. 
      Physiological response measuring techniques such as eye tracking, skin 
      conductance recording, heart rate monitoring, and facial mapping have also been 
      found in these empirical studies exclusively or in parallel with brain 
      recordings. Alongside traditional filtering methods, independent component 
      analysis (ICA) was found most commonly in artifact removal from neural signal. In 
      consumer response prediction and classification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), 
      Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have 
      performed with the highest average accuracy among other machine learning 
      algorithms used in these literatures. The authors hope, this review will assist 
      the future researchers with vital information in the field of Neuromarketing for 
      making novel contributions.

AB  - Wearable dry electrodes are needed for long-term biopotential recordings but 
      are limited by their imperfect compliance with the skin, especially during body 
      movements and sweat secretions, resulting in high interfacial impedance and 
      motion artifacts. Herein, we report an intrinsically conductive polymer dry 
      electrode with excellent self-adhesiveness, stretchability, and conductivity. It 
      shows much lower skin-contact impedance and noise in static and dynamic 
      measurement than the current dry electrodes and standard gel electrodes, enabling 
      to acquire high-quality electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) and 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in various conditions such as dry and wet skin 
      and during body movement. Hence, this dry electrode can be used for long-term 
      healthcare monitoring in complex daily conditions. We further investigated the 
      capabilities of this electrode in a clinical setting and realized its ability to 
      detect the arrhythmia features of atrial fibrillation accurately, and quantify 
      muscle activity during deep tendon reflex testing and contraction against 
      resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the early specialization of golf players, examining the within 
      session sequence of training should be considered to enhance performance and 
      prevent injury risk. The present study analyzed the effects of an 18-week 
      concurrent training developed before or after a specific golf session in 
      adolescence elite golfers on several performance factors. METHODS: Sixteen 
      right-handed male golfers, were randomly divided into two groups: after golf 
      specific training (AG) (n = 8, age: 16.77 ± 0.58 years) and before golf specific 
      training (BG) (n = 8, age: 16.93 ± 0.59 years). AG and BG players followed a 
      concurrent physical conditioning program (CT) after or before the golf specific 
      training, respectively. Body mass, body fat, muscle mass, jumping ability (CMJ), 
      ball speed (Sball), golf movements screens (GMS), power in a golf swing-specific 
      cable woodchop (Wmax) and the perceived training load (TL) in golf specific 
      training (TL-G) and TL in CT (TL-CT) were measured on three separate occasions. 
      RESULTS: BG demonstrates a lower TL-CT than AG (p < .001, ηp2 = 0.90 ) along the 
      training program without effects on TL-G, achieving significant percentage of 
      change on CMJ (9.38%; p = .165; d = 0.73), GMS (50.52%; p = .41, d = 0.91), Wmax 
      (16.93%; p = .001; d = 2.02) and Sball (1.82%; p = .018; d = 0.92) without 
      interaction effects on anthropometric measures. CONCLUSIONS: Performing CT 
      sessions before the regular golf training can improve specific performance 
      factors with a lower perceived TL than the same training carried out after the 
      regular golf training.

TI  - Distinguishing Epileptiform Discharges From Normal Electroencephalograms Using 
      Scale-Dependent Lyapunov Exponent.
PG  - 1006

LID - 1006
AB  - Epileptiform discharges are of fundamental importance in understanding the 
      physiology of epilepsy. To aid in the clinical diagnosis, classification, 
      prognosis, and treatment of epilepsy, it is important to develop automated 
      computer programs to distinguish epileptiform discharges from normal 
      electroencephalogram (EEG). This is a challenging task as clinically used scalp 
      EEG often contains a lot of noise and motion artifacts. The challenge is even 
      greater if one wishes to develop explainable rather than black-box based 
      approaches. To take on this challenge, we propose to use a multiscale complexity 
      measure, the scale-dependent Lyapunov exponent (SDLE). We analyzed 640 
      multi-channel EEG segments, each 4 s long. Among these segments, 540 are short 
      epileptiform discharges, and 100 are from healthy controls. We found that 
      features from SDLE were very effective in distinguishing epileptiform discharges 
      from normal EEG. Using Random Forest Classifier (RF) and Support Vector Machines 
      (SVM), the proposed approach with different features from SDLE robustly achieves 
      an accuracy exceeding 99% in distinguishing epileptiform discharges from normal 
      control ones. A single parameter, which is the ratio of the spectral energy of 
      EEG signals and the SDLE and quantifies the regularity or predictability of the 
      EEG signals, is introduced to better understand the high accuracy in the 
      classification. It is found that this regularity is considerably greater for 
      epileptiform discharges than for normal controls. Robustly having high accuracy 
      in distinguishing epileptiform discharges from normal controls irrespective of 
      which classification scheme being used, the proposed approach has the potential 
      to be used widely in a clinical setting.

TI  - Validation of an Automatic Arousal Detection Algorithm for Whole-Night Sleep EEG 
      Recordings.
PG  - 258-272
LID - 10.3390/clockssleep2030020 [doi]
AB  - Arousals during sleep are transient accelerations of the EEG signal, considered 
      to reflect sleep perturbations associated with poorer sleep quality. They are 
      typically detected by visual inspection, which is time consuming, subjective, and 
      prevents good comparability across scorers, studies and research centres. We 
      developed a fully automatic algorithm which aims at detecting artefact and 
      arousal events in whole-night EEG recordings, based on time-frequency analysis 
      with adapted thresholds derived from individual data. We ran an automated 
      detection of arousals over 35 sleep EEG recordings in healthy young and older 
      individuals and compared it against human visual detection from two research 
      centres with the aim to evaluate the algorithm performance. Comparison across 
      human scorers revealed a high variability in the number of detected arousals, 
      which was always lower than the number detected automatically. Despite indexing 
      more events, automatic detection showed high agreement with human detection as 
      reflected by its correlation with human raters and very good Cohen's kappa 
      values. Finally, the sex of participants and sleep stage did not influence 
      performance, while age may impact automatic detection, depending on the human 
      rater considered as gold standard. We propose our freely available algorithm as a 
      reliable and time-sparing alternative to visual detection of arousals.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) concurrently collected with functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) is heavily distorted by the repetitive gradient coil 
      switching during the fMRI acquisition. The performance of the typical 
      template-based gradient artifact suppression method can be suboptimal because the 
      artifact changes over time. Gradient artifact residuals also impede the 
      subsequent suppression of ballistocardiography artifacts. Here we propose 
      recording continuous EEG with temporally sparse fast fMRI (fast fMRI-EEG) to 
      minimize the EEG artifacts caused by MRI gradient coil switching without 
      significantly compromising the field-of-view and spatiotemporal resolution of 
      fMRI. Using simultaneous multi-slice inverse imaging to achieve whole-brain fMRI 
      with isotropic 5-mm resolution in 0.1 ​s, and performing these acquisitions once 
      every 2 ​s, we have 95% of the duty cycle available to record EEG with 
      substantially less gradient artifact. We found that the standard deviation of EEG 
      signals over the entire acquisition period in fast fMRI-EEG was reduced to 54% of 
      that in conventional concurrent echo-planar imaging (EPI) and EEG recordings 
      (EPI-EEG) across participants. When measuring 15-Hz steady-state visual evoked 
      potentials (SSVEPs), the baseline-normalized oscillatory neural response in fast 
      fMRI-EEG was 2.5-fold of that in EPI-EEG. The functional MRI responses associated 
      with the SSVEP delineated by EPI and fast fMRI were similar in the spatial 
      distribution, the elicited waveform, and detection power. Sparsely interleaved 
      fast fMRI-EEG provides high-quality EEG without substantially compromising the 
      quality of fMRI in evoked response measurements, and has the potential utility 
      for applications where the onset of the target stimulus cannot be precisely 
      determined, such as epilepsy.

TI  - Mediolateral damping of an overhead body weight support system assists stability 
      during treadmill walking.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s12984-020-00735-w [doi]
LID - 108
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body weight support systems with three or more degrees of freedom 
      (3-DoF) are permissive and safe environments that provide unloading and allow 
      unrestricted movement in any direction. This enables training of walking and 
      balance control at an early stage in rehabilitation. Transparent systems generate 
      a support force vector that is near vertical at all positions in the workspace to 
      only minimally interfere with natural movement patterns. Patients with impaired 
      balance, however, may benefit from additional mediolateral support that can be 
      adjusted according to their capacity. An elegant solution for providing balance 
      support might be by rendering viscous damping along the mediolateral axis via the 
      software controller. Before use with patients, we evaluated if control-rendered 
      mediolateral damping evokes the desired stability enhancement in able-bodied 
      individuals. METHODS: A transparent, cable-driven robotic body weight support 
      system (FLOAT) was used to provide transparent body weight support with and 
      without mediolateral damping to 21 able-bodied volunteers while walking at 
      preferred gait velocity on a treadmill. Stability metrics reflecting resistance 
      to small and large perturbations were derived from walking kinematics and 
      compared between conditions and to free walking. RESULTS: Compared to free 
      walking, the application of body weight support per-se resulted in gait 
      alterations typically associated with body weight support, namely increased step 
      length and swing phase. Frontal plane dynamic stability, measured by kinematic 
      variability and nonlinear dynamics of the center of mass, was increased under 
      body weight support, indicating reduced balance requirements in both damped and 
      undamped support conditions. Adding damping to the body weight support resulted 
      in a greater increase of frontal plane stability. CONCLUSION: Adding mediolateral 
      damping to 3-DoF body weight support systems is an effective method of increasing 
      frontal plane stability during walking in able-bodied participants. Building on 
      these results, adjustable mediolateral damping could enable therapists to select 
      combinations of unloading and stability specifically for each patient and to 
      adapt this in a task specific manner. This could extend the impact of transparent 
      3-DoF body weight support systems, enabling training of gait and active balance 
      from an early time point onwards in the rehabilitation process for a wide range 
      of mobility activities of daily life.

TI  - Distinguishing Epileptiform Discharges From Normal Electroencephalograms Using 
      Adaptive Fractal and Network Analysis: A Clinical Perspective.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the brain. Clinically, to 
      corroborate an epileptic seizure-like symptom and to find the seizure 
      localization, electroencephalogram (EEG) data are often visually examined by a 
      clinical doctor to detect the presence of epileptiform discharges. Epileptiform 
      discharges are transient waveforms lasting for several tens to hundreds of 
      milliseconds and are mainly divided into seven types. It is important to develop 
      systematic approaches to accurately distinguish these waveforms from normal 
      control ones. This is a difficult task if one wishes to develop first principle 
      rather than black-box based approaches, since clinically used scalp EEGs usually 
      contain a lot of noise and artifacts. To solve this problem, we analyzed 640 
      multi-channel EEG segments, each 4s long. Among these segments, 540 are short 
      epileptiform discharges, and 100 are from healthy controls. We have proposed two 
      approaches for distinguishing epileptiform discharges from normal EEGs. The first 
      method is based on Signal Range and EEGs' long range correlation properties 
      characterized by the Hurst parameter H extracted by applying adaptive fractal 
      analysis (AFA), which can also maximally suppress the effects of noise and 
      various kinds of artifacts. Our second method is based on networks constructed 
      from three aspects of the scalp EEG signals, the Signal Range, the energy of the 
      alpha wave component, and EEG's long range correlation properties. The networks 
      are further analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD). The square of the 
      first singular value from SVD is used to construct features to distinguish 
      epileptiform discharges from normal controls. Using Random Forest Classifier 
      (RF), our approaches can achieve very high accuracy in distinguishing 
      epileptiform discharges from normal control ones, and thus are very promising to 
      be used clinically. The network-based approach is also used to infer the 
      localizations of each type of epileptiform discharges, and it is found that the 
      sub-networks representing the most likely location of each type of epileptiform 
      discharges are different among the seven types of epileptiform discharges.

TI  - Delta oscillations are a robust biomarker of dopamine depletion severity and 
      motor dysfunction in awake mice.
PG  - 312-329
LID - 10.1152/jn.00158.2020 [doi]
AB  - Delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) are a robust feature of basal ganglia 
      pathophysiology in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in relationship to 
      tremor, but their relationship to other parkinsonian symptoms has not been 
      investigated. While delta oscillations have been observed in mouse models of PD, 
      they have only been investigated in anesthetized animals, suggesting that the 
      oscillations may be an anesthesia artifact and limiting the ability to relate 
      them to motor symptoms. Here, we establish a novel approach to detect spike 
      oscillations embedded in noise to provide the first study of delta oscillations 
      in awake, dopamine-depleted mice. We find that approximately half of neurons in 
      the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) exhibit delta oscillations in dopamine 
      depletion and that these oscillations are a strong indicator of dopamine loss and 
      akinesia, outperforming measures such as changes in firing rate, irregularity, 
      bursting, and synchrony. These oscillations are typically weakened, but not 
      ablated, during movement. We further establish that these oscillations are caused 
      by the loss of D2-receptor activation and do not originate from motor cortex, 
      contrary to previous findings in anesthetized animals. Instead, SNr oscillations 
      precede those in M1 at a 100- to 300-ms lag, and these neurons' relationship to 
      M1 oscillations can be used as the basis for a novel classification of SNr into 
      two subpopulations. These results give insight into how dopamine loss leads to 
      motor dysfunction and suggest a reappraisal of delta oscillations as a marker of 
      akinetic symptoms in PD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work introduces a novel method to 
      detect spike oscillations amidst neural noise. Using this method, we demonstrate 
      that delta oscillations in the basal ganglia are a defining feature of awake, 
      dopamine-depleted mice and are strongly correlated with dopamine loss and 
      parkinsonian motor symptoms. These oscillations arise from a loss of D2-receptor 
      activation and do not require motor cortex. Similar oscillations in human 
      patients may be an underappreciated marker and target for Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) treatment.

AB  - There are questions and challenges regarding neurologic complications in COVID-19 
      patients. EEG is a safe and efficient tool for the evaluation of brain function, 
      even in the context of COVID-19. However, EEG technologists should not be put in 
      danger if obtaining an EEG does not significantly advance diagnosis or change 
      management in the patient. Not every neurologic problem stems from a primary 
      brain injury: confusion, impaired consciousness that evolves to stupor and coma, 
      and headaches are frequent in hypercapnic/hypoxic encephalopathies. In patients 
      with chronic pulmonary disorders, acute symptomatic seizures have been reported 
      in acute respiratory failure in 6%. The clinician should be aware of the various 
      EEG patterns in hypercapnic/hypoxic and anoxic (post-cardiac arrest syndrome) 
      encephalopathies as well as encephalitides. In this emerging pandemic of 
      infectious disease, reduced EEG montages using single-use subdermal EEG needle 
      electrodes may be used in comatose patients. A full 10-20 EEG complement of 
      electrodes with an ECG derivation remains the standard. Under COVID-19 
      conditions, an expedited study that adequately screens for generalized status 
      epilepticus, most types of regional status epilepticus, encephalopathy or sleep 
      may serve for most clinical questions, using simplified montages may limit the 
      risk of infection to EEG technologists. We recommend noting whether the patient 
      is undergoing or has been placed prone, as well as noting the body and head 
      position during the EEG recording (supine versus prone) to avoid 
      overinterpretation of respiratory, head movement, electrode, muscle or other 
      artifacts. There is slight elevation of intracranial pressure in the prone 
      position. In non-comatose patients, the hyperventilation procedure should be 
      avoided. At present, non-specific EEG findings and abnormalities should not be 
      considered as being specific for COVID-19 related encephalopathy.

TI  - Adjusting ADJUST: Optimizing the ADJUST algorithm for pediatric data using 
      geodesic nets.
PG  - e13566
LID - 10.1111/psyp.13566 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge for electroencephalograph (EEG) studies on pediatric 
      populations is that large amounts of data are lost due to artifacts (e.g., 
      movement and blinks). Independent component analysis (ICA) can separate 
      artifactual and neural activity, allowing researchers to remove such artifactual 
      activity and retain a greater percentage of EEG data for analyses. However, 
      manual identification of artifactual components is time-consuming and requires 
      subjective judgment. Automated algorithms, like ADJUST and ICLabel, have been 
      validated on adults, but to our knowledge, no such algorithms have been optimized 
      for pediatric data. Therefore, in an attempt to automate artifact selection for 
      pediatric data collected with geodesic nets, we modified ADJUST's algorithm. Our 
      "adjusted-ADJUST" algorithm was compared to the "original-ADJUST" algorithm and 
      ICLabel in adults, children, and infants on three different performance measures: 
      respective classification agreement with expert coders, the number of trials 
      retained following artifact removal, and the reliability of the EEG signal after 
      preprocessing with each algorithm. Overall, the adjusted-ADJUST algorithm 
      performed better than the original-ADJUST algorithm and no ICA correction with 
      adult and pediatric data. Moreover, in some measures, it performed better than 
      ICLabel for pediatric data. These results indicate that optimizing existing 
      algorithms improves artifact classification and retains more trials, potentially 
      facilitating EEG studies with pediatric populations. Adjusted-ADJUST is freely

AB  - Alternating current stimulation is a promising method for the study and treatment 
      of various visual neurological dysfunctions as well as progressive understanding 
      of the healthy brain. Unfortunately, due to the current stimulation artifact, 
      problems remain in the context of analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) 
      signal recorded during ongoing stimulation. To address this problem, we propose 
      the use of a simple moving average subtraction as a method for artifact 
      elimination. This method involves the creation of a template of the stimulation 
      artifact from EEG signal recorded during non-invasive electrical stimulation with 
      a sinusoidal alternating current. The present report describes results of the 
      effects of a simple moving average filtration that varies based on averaging 
      parameters; in particular, we varied the number of sinusoidal periods per segment 
      of the recorded signal and the number of segments used to construct an artifact 
      template. Given the ongoing lack of a mathematical model that allows for the 
      prediction of the "hidden" EEG signal with the alternating current stimulation 
      artifact, we propose performing an earlier simulation that is based on the 
      addition of artificial stimulation artifact to the known EEG signal. This 
      solution allows for the optimization of filtering parameters with detailed 
      knowledge about the accuracy of artifact removal. The algorithm, designed in the 
      MATLAB environment, has been tested on data recorded from two volunteers 
      subjected to sinusoidal transorbital alternating current stimulation. Analysis of 
      the percentage difference between the original and filtered signal in time and 
      frequency domain highlights the advantage of 1-period filtration.

      Systematic Review and Recommendations for Best Practice.

AB  - Background: The effects of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI)-neurofeedback on brain activation and behaviors have 
      been studied extensively in the past. More recently, researchers have begun to 
      investigate the effects of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based 
      neurofeedback (fNIRS-neurofeedback). FNIRS is a functional neuroimaging technique 
      based on brain hemodynamics, which is easy to use, portable, inexpensive, and has 
      reduced sensitivity to movement artifacts. Method: We provide the first 
      systematic review and database of fNIRS-neurofeedback studies, synthesizing 
      findings from 22 peer-reviewed studies (including a total of N = 441 
      participants; 337 healthy, 104 patients). We (1) give a comprehensive overview of 
      how fNIRS-neurofeedback training protocols were implemented, (2) review the 
      online signal-processing methods used, (3) evaluate the quality of studies using 
      pre-set methodological and reporting quality criteria and also present 
      statistical sensitivity/power analyses, (4) investigate the effectiveness of 
      fNIRS-neurofeedback in modulating brain activation, and (5) review its 
      effectiveness in changing behavior in healthy and pathological populations. 
      Results and discussion: (1-2) Published studies are heterogeneous (e.g., 
      neurofeedback targets, investigated populations, applied training protocols, and 
      methods). (3) Large randomized controlled trials are still lacking. In view of 
      the novelty of the field, the quality of the published studies is moderate. We 
      identified room for improvement in reporting important information and 
      statistical power to detect realistic effects. (4) Several studies show that 
      people can regulate hemodynamic signals from cortical brain regions with 
      fNIRS-neurofeedback and (5) these studies indicate the feasibility of modulating 
      motor control and prefrontal brain functioning in healthy participants and 
      ameliorating symptoms in clinical populations (stroke, ADHD, autism, and social 
      anxiety). However, valid conclusions about specificity or potential clinical 
      utility are premature. Conclusion: Due to the advantages of practicability and 
      relatively low cost, fNIRS-neurofeedback might provide a suitable and powerful 
      alternative to EEG and fMRI neurofeedback and has great potential for clinical 
      translation of neurofeedback. Together with more rigorous research and reporting 
      practices, further methodological improvements may lead to a more solid 
      understanding of fNIRS-neurofeedback. Future research will benefit from 
      exploiting the advantages of fNIRS, which offers unique opportunities for 
      neurofeedback research.

      magnetoencephalography.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an excellent non-invasive tool to 
      study the brain. However, measurements often suffer from the contribution of 
      external interference, including noise from the sensors. Suppression of noise 
      from the data is critical for an accurate representation of brain signals. Due to 
      MEG's limited spatial resolution and superior temporal resolution, noise 
      suppression methods that operate in the temporal domain can be favorable. NEW 
      METHOD: We examined the independent and joint effects of two temporal projection 
      noise suppression algorithms for MEG measurements: One commonly used algorithm 
      which suppresses correlated noise; temporal signal space separation (tSSS) and 
      one new method which suppresses uncorrelated sensor noise; oversampled temporal 
      projection (OTP). RESULTS: We found that both OTP and tSSS effectively suppress 
      noise in raw MEG data and have the greatest effect of joint operation in cases 
      where SNR is low, or when detecting higher SNR single-trial responses from raw 
      data. We additionally demonstrate how the combination of OTP and tSSS is useful 
      for the detectability of high-frequency brain oscillations (HFO). COMPARISON WITH 
      EXISTING METHODS: Although the mathematical description of OTP has been described 
      before (Larson and Taulu, 2017), OTP's effect on HFOs in MEG data is novel. 
      Additionally, the combination of OTP and commonly used temporal noise suppression 
      algorithms (i.e., tSSS) has not been shown. CONCLUSIONS: This finding is 
      applicable to clinical populations such as epilepsy, where HFO signals are 
      thought to be important markers for areas of seizure onset and are typically 
      difficult to detect with non-invasive neuroimaging methods.

AB  - The cerebellum plays a key role in the regulation of motor learning, coordination 
      and timing, and has been implicated in sensory and cognitive processes as well. 
      However, our current knowledge of its electrophysiological mechanisms comes 
      primarily from direct recordings in animals, as investigations into cerebellar 
      function in humans have instead predominantly relied on lesion, haemodynamic and 
      metabolic imaging studies. While the latter provide fundamental insights into the 
      contribution of the cerebellum to various cerebellar-cortical pathways mediating 
      behaviour, they remain limited in terms of temporal and spectral resolution. In 
      principle, this shortcoming could be overcome by monitoring the cerebellum's 
      electrophysiological signals. Non-invasive assessment of cerebellar 
      electrophysiology in humans, however, is hampered by the limited spatial 
      resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 
      subcortical structures, i.e., deep sources. Furthermore, it has been argued that 
      the anatomical configuration of the cerebellum leads to signal cancellation in 
      MEG and EEG. Yet, claims that MEG and EEG are unable to detect cerebellar 
      activity have been challenged by an increasing number of studies over the last 
      decade. Here we address this controversy and survey reports in which 
      electrophysiological signals were successfully recorded from the human 
      cerebellum. We argue that the detection of cerebellum activity non-invasively 
      with MEG and EEG is indeed possible and can be enhanced with appropriate methods, 
      in particular using connectivity analysis in source space. We provide 
      illustrative examples of cerebellar activity detected with MEG and EEG. 
      Furthermore, we propose practical guidelines to optimize the detection of 
      cerebellar activity with MEG and EEG. Finally, we discuss MEG and EEG signal 
      contamination that may lead to localizing spurious sources in the cerebellum and 
      suggest ways of handling such artefacts. This review is to be read as a 
      perspective review that highlights that it is indeed possible to measure 
      cerebellum with MEG and EEG and encourages MEG and EEG researchers to do so. Its 
      added value beyond highlighting and encouraging is that it offers useful advice 
      for researchers aspiring to investigate the cerebellum with MEG and EEG.

PG  - 5927657

LID - 5927657
AB  - In this research, we proposed a lower-limb soft exoskeleton for providing 
      assistive forces to patients with muscle weakness during the preswing phase of a 
      gait cycle. Whereas conventional soft exoskeletons employ two motors to assist 
      each leg individually, we designed a single motor for actuation. Our design 
      assists hip flexion for light weights and prevents some slip problems that can 
      arise from rotary motors. The actuation mechanism was based on a pulley system 
      that converted the power supplied by the single motor into linear reciprocating 
      motions of a slider. When the single motor rotated, the slider moved linearly, 
      first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. The slider pulled knee 
      braces through cables with an assistive force of 100 N. The actuation was 
      triggered when the system detected that the backward swing of the wearer's thigh 
      had ended. A prototype was designed, fabricated, and examined with 7 subjects 
      (average age, 24). Subjects were measured while they wore our exoskeleton in 
      power-off and power-on modes. Comparisons proved that wearing the exoskeleton 
      caused a negligible deviation of gait, and that the soft exoskeleton could reduce 
      metabolic cost during walking. The research results are expected to be beneficial 
      for lightweight soft exoskeletons and integration with exosuits that provide 
      assistive forces through the wearer's entire gait.

AB  - Motor imagery (MI) is one of the important brain-computer interface (BCI) 
      paradigms, which can be used to control peripherals without external stimulus. 
      Imagining the movements of different joints of the same limb allows intuitive 
      control of the outer devices. In this report, we describe an open access 
      multi-subject dataset for MI of different joints from the same limb. This 
      experiment collected data from twenty-five healthy subjects on three tasks: 1) 
      imagining the movement of right hand, 2) imagining the movement of right elbow, 
      and 3) keeping resting with eyes open, which results in a total of 22,500 trials. 
      The dataset provided includes data of three stages: 1) raw recorded data, 2) 
      pre-processed data after operations such as artifact removal, and 3) trial data 
      that can be directly used for feature extraction and classification. Different 
      researchers can reuse the dataset according to their needs. We expect that this 
      dataset will facilitate the analysis of brain activation patterns of the same 
      limb and the study of decoding techniques for MI.

      Applied to Three BCI Paradigms.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially 
      enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain 
      activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth 
      clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification 
      hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard 
      technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated 
      independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information 
      because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs 
      when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve 
      this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based 
      automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from 
      observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the 
      frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal 
      separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named 
      ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the 
      discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were 
      determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG 
      data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related 
      potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI 
      performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact 
      reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the 
      potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In 
      addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 
      70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for 
      most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised 
      separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the 
      usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently 
      contaminate EEGs.

TI  - Sleep disruption is not observed with brain-responsive neurostimulation for 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 155-165
LID - 10.1002/epi4.12382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurostimulation devices that deliver electrical impulses to the 
      nervous system are widely used to treat seizures in patients with medically 
      refractory epilepsy, but the effects of these therapies on sleep are incompletely 
      understood. Vagus nerve stimulation can contribute to obstructive sleep apnea, 
      and thalamic deep brain stimulation can cause sleep disruption. A device for 
      brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS(®) System, NeuroPace, Inc) is well 
      tolerated in clinical trials, but potential effects on sleep are unknown. 
      METHODS: Six adults with medically refractory focal epilepsy treated for at least 
      six months with the RNS System underwent a single night of polysomnography (PSG). 
      RNS System lead locations included mesial temporal and neocortical targets. Sleep 
      stages and arousals were scored according to standard guidelines. Stimulations 
      delivered by the RNS System in response to detections of epileptiform activity 
      were identified by artifacts on scalp electroencephalography. RESULTS: One 
      subject was excluded for technical reasons related to unreliable identification 
      of stimulation artifact on EEG during PSG. In the remaining five subjects, PSG 
      showed fragmented sleep with frequent arousals. Arousal histograms aligned to 
      stimulations revealed a significant peak in arousals just before stimulation. In 
      one of these subjects, the arousal peak began before stimulation and extended 
      ~1 seconds after stimulation. A peak in arousals occurring only after stimulation 
      was not observed. SIGNIFICANCE: In this small cohort of patients, 
      brain-responsive neurostimulation does not appear to disrupt sleep. If confirmed 
      in larger studies, this could represent a potential clinical advantage of 
      brain-responsive neurostimulation over other neurostimulation modalities.

AB  - This article presents a collection of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded 
      from 14 participants, that includes 7 participants with Intellectual and 
      Developmental Disorder (IDD) and 7 Typically Developing Controls (TDC) under 
      resting-state and under music stimuli. The EEG data were acquired using the 
      EMOTIV EPOC+ device that is a 14-channel dry electrode device. The article 
      provides two types of data: (1) Raw EEG data under resting-state and with music 
      stimuli (i.e., task based data) and (2) pre-processed EEG data under resting 
      state and with music stimuli. Alongside this data, we provide a robust and fully 
      automated pre-processing pipeline for EEG data. The pipeline performs filtering, 
      line noise removal, data selection, ICA, and automatic artefact removal.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging 
      technique for pediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion 
      by motion. Compared to adults, infants' motion is both more frequent and less 
      stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely 
      undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion 
      effects on the infant EEG signal. EEG recordings were performed with 14 infants 
      (12 analyzed) who passively watched movies whilst spontaneously producing periods 
      of bodily movement and rest. Each infant produced an average of 38.3 s (SD = 14.7 
      s) of rest and 18.8 s (SD = 17.9 s) of single motion segments for the final 
      analysis. Five types of infant motions were analyzed: Jaw movements, and Limb 
      movements of the Hand, Arm, Foot, and Leg. Significant movement-related 
      distortions of the EEG signal were detected using cluster-based permutation 
      analysis. This analysis revealed that, relative to resting state, infants' Jaw 
      and Arm movements produced significant increases in beta (∼15 Hz) power, 
      particularly over peripheral sites. Jaw movements produced more anteriorly 
      located effects than Arm movements, which were most pronounced over posterior 
      parietal and occipital sites. The cluster analysis also revealed trends toward 
      decreased power in the theta and alpha bands observed over central topographies 
      for all motion types. However, given the very limited quantity of infant data in 
      this study, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings before 
      subsequent replications are conducted. Nonetheless, this work is an important 
      first step to inform future development of methods for addressing EEG 
      motion-related artifacts. This work also supports wider use of naturalistic 
      paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.

      Transform and Intelligent Techniques.

AB  - Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential because it is an 
      efficient method to diagnose neurological brain disorders. In this work, a single 
      system is developed to diagnose one or two neurological diseases at the same time 
      (two-class mode and three-class mode). For this purpose, different EEG 
      feature-extraction and classification techniques are investigated to aid in the 
      accurate diagnosis of neurological brain disorders: epilepsy and autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD). Two different modes, single-channel and multi-channel, of EEG 
      signals are analyzed for epilepsy and ASD. The independent components analysis 
      (ICA) technique is used to remove the artifacts from EEG dataset. Then, the EEG 
      dataset is segmented and filtered to remove noise and interference using an 
      elliptic band-pass filter. Next, the EEG signal features are extracted from the 
      filtered signal using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the 
      filtered signal to its sub-bands delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. 
      Subsequently, five statistical methods are used to extract features from the EEG 
      sub-bands: the logarithmic band power (LBP), standard deviation, variance, 
      kurtosis, and Shannon entropy (SE). Further, the features are fed into four 
      different classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine 
      (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to 
      classify the features corresponding to their classes. The combination of DWT with 
      SE and LBP produces the highest accuracy among all the classifiers. The overall 
      classification accuracy approaches 99.9% using SVM and 97% using ANN for the 
      three-class single-channel and multi-channel modes, respectively.

AB  - The visual analysis of common neurological disorders such as epileptic seizures 
      in electroencephalography (EEG) is an oversensitive operation and prone to 
      errors, which has motivated the researchers to develop effective automated 
      seizure detection methods. This paper proposes a robust automatic seizure 
      detection method that can establish a veritable diagnosis of these diseases. The 
      proposed method consists of three steps: (i) remove artifact from EEG data using 
      Savitzky-Golay filter and multi-scale principal component analysis (MSPCA), (ii) 
      extract features from EEG signals using signal decomposition representations 
      based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), 
      and dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) allowing to overcome the 
      non-linearity and non-stationary of EEG signals, and (iii) allocate the feature 
      vector to the relevant class ( i.e., seizure class "ictal" or free seizure class 
      "interictal") using machine learning techniques such as support vector machine 
      (SVM), k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The 
      experimental results were based on two EEG datasets generated from the CHB-MIT 
      database with and without overlapping process. The results obtained have shown 
      the effectiveness of the proposed method that allows achieving a higher 
      classification accuracy rate up to 100% and also outperforms similar 
      state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Effective automated method for detection and suppression of muscle artefacts from 
      single-channel EEG signal.
PG  - 35-40
LID - 10.1049/htl.2019.0053 [doi]
AB  - This Letter proposes an automated method for the detection and suppression of 
      muscle artefacts (MAs) in the single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal 
      based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and zero crossings count threshold 
      criterion without the use of reference electromyogram (EMG). The proposed method 
      involves three major steps: decomposition of the input EEG signal into two modes 
      using VMD; detection of MAs based on zero crossings count thresholding in the 
      second mode; retention of the first mode as MAs-free EEG signal only after 
      detection of MAs in the second mode. The authors evaluate the robustness of the 
      proposed method on a variety of EEG and EMG signals taken from publicly available 
      databases, including Mendeley database, epileptic Bonn database and EEG during 
      mental arithmetic tasks database (EEGMAT). Evaluation results using different 
      objective performance metrics depict the superiority of the proposed method as 
      compared to existing methods while preserving the clinical features of the 
      reconstructed EEG signal.

TI  - Signal recovery from stimulation artifacts in intracranial recordings with 
      dictionary learning.
PG  - 026023
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ab7a4f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electrical stimulation of the human brain is commonly used for 
      eliciting and inhibiting neural activity for clinical diagnostics, modifying 
      abnormal neural circuit function for therapeutics, and interrogating cortical 
      connectivity. However, recording electrical signals with concurrent stimulation 
      results in dominant electrical artifacts that mask the neural signals of 
      interest. Here we develop a method to reproducibly and robustly recover neural 
      activity during concurrent stimulation. We concentrate on signal recovery across 
      an array of electrodes without channel-wise fine-tuning of the algorithm. Our 
      goal includes signal recovery with trains of stimulation pulses, since repeated, 
      high-frequency pulses are often required to induce desired effects in both 
      therapeutic and research domains. We have made all of our code and data publicly 
      available. APPROACH: We developed an algorithm that automatically detects 
      templates of artifacts across many channels of recording, creating a dictionary 
      of learned templates using unsupervised clustering. The artifact template that 
      best matches each individual artifact pulse is subtracted to recover the 
      underlying activity. To assess the success of our method, we focus on whether it 
      extracts physiologically interpretable signals from real recordings. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We demonstrate our signal recovery approach on invasive 
      electrophysiologic recordings from human subjects during stimulation. We show the 
      recovery of meaningful neural signatures in both electrocorticographic (ECoG) 
      arrays and deep brain stimulation (DBS) recordings. In addition, we compared 
      cortical responses induced by the stimulation of primary somatosensory (S1) by 
      natural peripheral touch, as well as motor cortex activity with and without 
      concurrent S1 stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Our work will enable future advances in 
      neural engineering with simultaneous stimulation and recording.

AB  - Walking is one of the most relevant tasks that a person performs in their daily 
      routine. Despite its mechanical complexities, any change in the external 
      conditions that applies some external perturbation, or in the human 
      musculoskeletal system that limits an individual's movement, entails a motor 
      response that can either be compensatory or adaptive in nature. Incidentally, 
      with aging or due to the occurrence of a neuro-musculoskeletal disorder, a 
      combination of such changes including reduced sensory perception, muscle 
      weakness, spasticity, etc. has been reported, and this can significantly degrade 
      the human walking performance. Various studies in gait rehabilitation literature 
      have identified a need for the development of better rehabilitation paradigms and 
      have implied that an efficient human robot interaction is critical. Understanding 
      how humans respond to a particular gait alteration can be beneficial in designing 
      an effective rehabilitation paradigm. In this context, the current work 
      investigates human locomotor adaptation to resistive alteration to the hip and 
      ankle strategies of walking. A cable-driven robotic system, which does not add 
      mobility constraints, was used to implement resistive force interventions within 
      the hip and ankle joints separately through two experiments with eight healthy 
      adult participants in each. In both cases, the intervention was applied during 
      the push-off phase of walking, i.e., from pre-swing to terminal swing. The 
      results showed that subjects in both groups adopted a compensatory response to 
      the applied intervention and demonstrated intralimb and interlimb adaptation. 
      Overall, the participants demonstrated a deviant gait implying lower limb 
      musculoskeletal adjustments as if to compensate for a hip or ankle abnormality.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are technologies that provide the user with an 
      alternative way of communication. A BCI measures brain activity (e.g. EEG) and 
      converts it into output commands. Motor imagery (MI), the mental simulation of 
      movements, can be used as a BCI paradigm, where the movement intention of the 
      user can be translated into a real movement, helping patients in motor recovery 
      rehabilitation. One of the main limitations for the broad use of such devices is 
      the high cost associated with the high-quality equipment used for capturing the 
      biomedical signals. Different low-cost consumer-grade alternatives have emerged 
      with the objective of bringing these systems closer to the final users. The 
      quality of the signals obtained with such equipments has already been evaluated 
      and found to be competitive with those obtained with well-known clinical-grade 
      devices. However, how these consumer-grade technologies can be integrated and 
      used for practical MI-BCIs has not yet been explored. In this work, we provide a 
      detailed description of the advantages and disadvantages of using OpenBCI boards, 
      low-cost sensors and open-source software for constructing an entirely 
      consumer-grade MI-BCI system. An analysis of the quality of the signals acquired 
      and the MI detection ability is performed. Even though communication between the 
      computer and the OpenBCI board is not always stable and the signal quality is 
      sometimes affected by ambient noise, we find that by means of a filter-bank based 
      method, similar classification performances can be achieved with an MI-BCI built 
      under low-cost consumer-grade devices as compared to when clinical-grade systems 
      are used. By means of this work we share with the BCI community our experience on 
      working with emerging low-cost technologies, providing evidence that an entirely 
      low-cost MI-BCI can be built. We believe that if communication stability and 
      artifact rejection are improved, these technologies will become a valuable 
      alternative to clinical-grade devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using the Twente Medical Systems international B.V. (TMSi) 
      electromyography (EMG) system, active signal shielding was applied to clean 
      signals and create data without interference and cable movement artifacts. TMSi, 
      used in high-density surface EMG pattern recognition, controls myoelectric 
      rehabilitation robots, yet few have studied how active signal shielding 
      influences pattern recognition. This study aimed to investigate how active signal 
      shielding used within the TMSi influenced motion pattern recognition. METHODS: 
      Surface EMG of dominant side forearm and hand muscles was studied in eight 
      healthy participants. The common component’s influence was accessed by the 
      classification performance of wrist and hand functional movements. RESULTS: The 
      classification performance of EMG signals with the common component was obviously 
      lower than signals without the common component using one to five electrodes. 
      Conversely, a higher motion classification performance was achieved using signals 
      with the common component using over 12 electrodes. Optimal channel distribution 
      was examined based on the sequential feed-forward selection method, showing that 
      the common component affected the optimal channel location. CONCLUSIONS: Active 
      signal shielding in the TMSi improved classification accuracy in motion pattern 
      recognition when over 12 electrodes were used. The optimal channel distribution 
      was related to the common component when using the TMSi.

TI  - Improving EEG Muscle Artifact Removal With an EMG Array.
PG  - 815-824
LID - 10.1109/tim.2019.2906967 [doi]
AB  - Removal of artifacts induced by muscle activity is crucial for analysis of the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG), and continues to be a challenge in experiments where 
      the subject may speak, change facial expressions, or move. Ensemble empirical 
      mode decomposition with canonical correlation analysis (EEMD-CCA) has been proven 
      to be an efficient method for denoising of EEG contaminated with muscle 
      artifacts. EEMD-CCA, likewise the majority of algorithms, does not incorporate 
      any statistical information of the artifact, namely, electromyogram (EMG) 
      recorded over the muscles actively contaminating the EEG. In this paper, we 
      propose to extend EEMD-CCA in order to include an EMG array as information to aid 
      the removal of artifacts, assessing the performance gain achieved when the number 
      of EMG channels grow. By filtering adaptively (recursive least squares, EMG array 
      as reference) each component resulting from CCA, we aim to ameliorate the 
      distortion of brain signals induced by artifacts and denoising methods. We 
      simulated several noise scenarios based on a linear contamination model, between 
      real and synthetic EEG and EMG signals, and varied the number of EMG channels 
      available to the filter. Our results exhibit a substantial improvement in the 
      performance as the number of EMG electrodes increase from 2 to 16. Further 
      increasing the number of EMG channels up to 128 did not have a significant impact 
      on the performance. We conclude by recommending the use of EMG electrodes to 
      filter components, as it is a computationally inexpensive enhancement that 
      impacts significantly on performance using only a few electrodes.

TI  - Faster Gait Speeds Reduce Alpha and Beta EEG Spectral Power From Human 
      Sensorimotor Cortex.
PG  - 842-853
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2019.2921766 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine if walking speed affected human sensorimotor 
      electrocortical dynamics using mobile high-density electroencephalography (EEG). 
      METHODS: To overcome limitations associated with motion and muscle artifact 
      contamination in EEG recordings, we compared solutions for artifact removal using 
      novel dual-layer EEG electrodes and alternative signal processing methods. 
      Dual-layer EEG simultaneously recorded human electrocortical signals and isolated 
      motion artifacts using pairs of mechanically coupled and electrically independent 
      electrodes. For electrical muscle activity removal, we incorporated 
      electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the neck into our mobile EEG data 
      processing pipeline. We compared artifact removal methods during treadmill 
      walking at four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s). RESULTS: Left and right 
      sensorimotor alpha and beta spectral power increased in contralateral limb single 
      support and push off, and decreased during contralateral limb swing at each 
      speed. At faster walking speeds, sensorimotor spectral power fluctuations were 
      less pronounced across the gait cycle with reduced alpha and beta power (p < 
      0.05) compared to slower speeds. Isolated noise recordings and neck EMG spectral 
      power fluctuations matched gait events and showed broadband spectral power 
      increases at faster speeds. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Dual-layer EEG enabled 
      us to isolate changes in human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics across 
      walking speeds. A comparison of signal processing approaches revealed similar 
      intrastride cortical fluctuations when applying common (e.g., artifact subspace 
      reconstruction) and novel artifact rejection methods. Dual-layer EEG, however, 
      allowed us to document and rule out residual artifacts, which exposed 
      sensorimotor spectral power changes across gait speeds.

TI  - Early Detection of Human Epileptic Seizures Based on Intracortical Microelectrode 
      Array Signals.
PG  - 817-831
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2019.2921448 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examine, for the first time, the use of intracortical 
      microelectrode array (MEA) signals for early detection of human epileptic 
      seizures. METHODS: 4×4 mm(2) 96-channel-MEA recordings were obtained during 
      neuro-monitoring preceding resective surgery in five participants. The 
      participant-specific seizure-detection framework consisted of: first, feature 
      extraction from local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity (MUA); 
      second, nonlinear cost-sensitive support vector machine (SVM) classification of 
      ictal and interictal states based on LFP, MUA, and combined LFP-MUA (a SVM was 
      trained for each participant separately); and third, Kalman filter postprocessing 
      of SVM scoring functions. Performance was assessed on data including 17 seizures 
      and 39.0 h interictal and preictal recordings. RESULTS: The use of combined 
      LFP-MUA features resulted in 100% sensitivity with short detection latency 
      (average: 2.7 s; median: 2.5 s) and five false alarms (0.13/h). The average 
      detection performance based on the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic corresponded to 0.97. Importantly, technically false alarms were 
      related to epileptiform activity, subclinical seizures, and recording artifacts. 
      Extreme gradient boosting classifiers ranked features based on LFP spectral 
      coherence or MUA count among the top features for seizures characterized by 
      spike-wave complexes, whereas features related to LFP power spectra were ranked 
      higher for seizures characterized by sustained gamma LFP oscillations. 
      CONCLUSION: The combination of intracortical LFP and MUA signals may allow 
      reliable detection of human epileptic seizures by improving latency and false 
      alarm rate. SIGNIFICANCE: Intracortical MEAs provide promising signals for 
      closed-loop seizure-control systems based on seizure early-detection in people 
      with pharmacologically resistant epilepsies.

AB  - Changes in human gait resulting from ageing or neurodegenerative diseases are 
      multifactorial. Here we assess the effects of age and Parkinson's disease (PD) on 
      corticospinal activity recorded during treadmill and overground walking. 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) from 10 electrodes and electromyography (EMG) from 
      bilateral tibialis anterior muscles were acquired from 22 healthy young, 24 
      healthy older and 20 adults with PD. Event-related power, corticomuscular 
      coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence were assessed for EEG from bilateral 
      sensorimotor cortices and EMG during the double-support phase of the gait cycle. 
      CMC and EMG power at low beta frequencies (13-21 Hz) was significantly decreased 
      in older and PD participants compared to young people, but there was no 
      difference between older and PD groups. Older and PD participants spent shorter 
      time in the swing phase than young individuals. These findings indicate 
      age-related changes in the temporal coordination of gait. The decrease in 
      low-beta CMC suggests reduced cortical input to spinal motor neurons in older 
      people during the double-support phase. We also observed multiple changes in 
      electrophysiological measures at low-gamma frequencies during treadmill compared 
      to overground walking, indicating task-dependent differences in corticospinal 
      locomotor control. These findings may be affected by artefacts and should be 
      interpreted with caution.

AB  - Power line artifacts are the bane of animal and human electrophysiology. A number 
      of methods are available to help attenuate or eliminate them, but each has its 
      own set of drawbacks. In this brief note I present a simple method that combines 
      the advantages of spectral and spatial filtering, while minimizing their 
      downsides. A perfect-reconstruction filterbank is used to split the data into two 
      parts, one noise-free and the other contaminated by line artifact. The 
      artifact-contaminated stream is processed by a spatial filter to project out line 
      components, and added to the noise-free part to obtain clean data. This method is 
      applicable to multichannel data such as electroencephalography (EEG), 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), or multichannel local field potentials (LFP). I 
      briefly review past methods, pointing out their drawbacks, describe the new 
      method, and evaluate the outcome using synthetic and real data.

      experiments.

AB  - Combining EEG with eye-tracking is a promising approach to study neural 
      correlates of natural vision, but the resulting recordings are also heavily 
      contaminated by activity of the eye balls, eye lids, and extraocular muscles. 
      While Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to suppress these 
      ocular artifacts, its performance under free viewing conditions has not been 
      systematically evaluated and many published reports contain residual artifacts. 
      Here I evaluated and optimized ICA-based correction for two tasks with 
      unconstrained eye movements: visual search in images and sentence reading. In a 
      first step, four parameters of the ICA pipeline were varied orthogonally: the (1) 
      high-pass and (2) low-pass filter applied to the training data, (3) the 
      proportion of training data containing myogenic saccadic spike potentials (SP), 
      and (4) the threshold for eye tracker-based component rejection. In a second 
      step, the eye-tracker was used to objectively quantify the correction quality of 
      each ICA solution, both in terms of undercorrection (residual artifacts) and 
      overcorrection (removal of neurogenic activity). As a benchmark, results were 
      compared to those obtained with an alternative spatial filter, Multiple Source 
      Eye Correction (MSEC). With commonly used settings, Infomax ICA not only left 
      artifacts in the data, but also distorted neurogenic activity during eye 
      movement-free intervals. However, correction results could be strongly improved 
      by training the ICA on optimally filtered data in which SPs were massively 
      overweighted. With optimized procedures, ICA removed virtually all artifacts, 
      including the SP and its associated spectral broadband artifact from both viewing 
      paradigms, with little distortion of neural activity. It also outperformed MSEC 
      in terms of SP correction. Matlab code is provided.

TI  - Detection of Postictal Generalized Electroencephalogram Suppression: Random 
      Forest Approach.
PG  - e17061
LID - 10.2196/17061 [doi]
LID - e17061
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is second only to stroke 
      in neurological events resulting in years of potential life lost. Postictal 
      generalized electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression (PGES) is a period of 
      suppressed brain activity often occurring after generalized tonic-clonic seizure, 
      a most significant risk factor for SUDEP. Therefore, PGES has been considered as 
      a potential biomarker for SUDEP risk. Automatic PGES detection tools can address 
      the limitations of labor-intensive, and sometimes inconsistent, visual analysis. 
      A successful approach to automatic PGES detection must overcome computational 
      challenges involved in the detection of subtle amplitude changes in EEG 
      recordings, which may contain physiological and acquisition artifacts. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to present a random forest approach for automatic PGES detection 
      using multichannel human EEG recordings acquired in epilepsy monitoring units. 
      METHODS: We used a combination of temporal, frequency, wavelet, and interchannel 
      correlation features derived from EEG signals to train a random forest 
      classifier. We also constructed and applied confidence-based correction rules 
      based on PGES state changes. Motivated by practical utility, we introduced a new, 
      time distance-based evaluation method for assessing the performance of PGES 
      detection algorithms. RESULTS: The time distance-based evaluation showed that our 
      approach achieved a 5-second tolerance-based positive prediction rate of 0.95 for 
      artifact-free signals. For signals with different artifact levels, our prediction 
      rates varied from 0.68 to 0.81. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a feature-based, 
      random forest approach for automatic PGES detection using multichannel EEG 
      recordings. Our approach achieved increasingly better time distance-based 
      performance with reduced signal artifact levels. Further study is needed for PGES 
      detection algorithms to perform well irrespective of the levels of signal 
      artifacts.

AB  - Recent studies aiming to facilitate mathematical skill development in primary 
      school children have explored the electrophysiological characteristics associated 
      with different levels of arithmetic achievement. The present work introduces an 
      alternative EEG signal characterization using graph metrics and, based on such 
      features, a classification analysis using a decision tree model. This proposal 
      aims to identify group differences in brain connectivity networks with respect to 
      mathematical skills in elementary school children. The methods of analysis 
      utilized were signal-processing (EEG artifact removal, Laplacian filtering, and 
      magnitude square coherence measurement) and the characterization (Graph metrics) 
      and classification (Decision Tree) of EEG signals recorded during performance of 
      a numerical comparison task. Our results suggest that the analysis of 
      quantitative EEG frequency-band parameters can be used successfully to 
      discriminate several levels of arithmetic achievement. Specifically, the most 
      significant results showed an accuracy of 80.00% (α band), 78.33% (δ band), and 
      76.67% (θ band) in differentiating high-skilled participants from low-skilled 
      ones, averaged-skilled subjects from all others, and averaged-skilled 
      participants from low-skilled ones, respectively. The use of a decision tree tool 
      during the classification stage allows the identification of several brain areas 
      that seem to be more specialized in numerical processing.

TI  - Adaptive spike-artifact removal from local field potentials uncovers prominent 
      beta and gamma band neuronal synchronization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many neurons synchronize their action potentials to the phase of 
      local field potential (LFP) fluctuations in one or more frequency bands. 
      Analyzing this spike-to-LFP synchronization is challenging, however, when neural 
      spikes and LFP are generated in the same local circuit, because the spike's 
      action potential waveform leak into the LFP and distort phase synchrony 
      estimates. Existing approaches to address this spike bleed-through artifact 
      relied on removing the average action potential waveforms of neurons, but this 
      leaves artifacts in the LFP and distorts synchrony estimates. NEW METHOD: We 
      describe a spike-removal method that surpasses these limitations by decomposing 
      individual action potentials into their frequency components before their removal 
      from the LFP. The adaptively estimated frequency components allow for variable 
      spread, strength and temporal variation of the spike artifact. RESULTS: This 
      adaptive approach effectively removes spike bleed-through artifacts in synthetic 
      data with known ground truth, and in single neuron and LFP recordings in nonhuman 
      primate striatum. For a large population of neurons with both narrow and broad 
      action potential waveforms, the use of adaptive artifact removal uncovered 
      20-35 Hz beta and 35-45 Hz gamma band spike-LFP synchronization that would have 
      remained contaminated otherwise. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We demonstrate 
      that adaptive spike-artifact removal cleans LFP data that remained contaminated 
      when applying existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods of average 
      spike-artifact removal. CONCLUSIONS: Applying adaptive spike-removal from field 
      potentials allows to estimate the phase at which neurons synchronize and the 
      consistency of their phase-locked firing for both beta and low gamma frequencies. 
      These metrics may prove essential to understand cell-to-circuit neuronal 
      interactions in multiple brain systems.

      epileptologist annotated 13,959 epileptiform discharges from a dataset of 
      intracranial EEG recordings from 46 epilepsy patients. Using this dataset, we 
      trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize mTL epileptiform 
      discharges from a single intracranial bipolar channel. The CNN outputs from 
      multiple bipolar channel inputs were averaged to generate the final detector 
      output. Algorithm performance was estimated using a nested 5-fold 
      cross-validation. RESULTS: On the receiver-operating characteristic curve, our 
      algorithm achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and a partial AUC (for 
      specificity > 0.9) of 0.981. AUC on a precision-recall curve was 0.807. A 
      sensitivity of 84% was attained at a false positive rate of 1 per minute. 35.9% 
      of the false positive detections corresponded to epileptiform discharges that 
      were missed during expert annotation. CONCLUSIONS: Using deep learning, we 
      developed a high-performing, patient non-specific algorithm for detection of mTL 
      epileptiform discharges on intracranial electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE: Our algorithm 
      has many potential applications for understanding the impact of mTL epileptiform 
      discharges in epilepsy and on cognition, and for developing therapies to 
      specifically reduce mTL epileptiform activity.

AB  - A common problem in neural recordings is the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
      particularly when using non-invasive techniques like magneto- or 
      electroencephalography (M/EEG). To address this problem, experimental designs 
      often include repeated trials, which are then averaged to improve the SNR or to 
      infer statistics that can be used in the design of a denoising spatial filter. 
      However, collecting enough repeated trials is often impractical and even 
      impossible in some paradigms, while analyses on existing data sets may be 
      hampered when these do not contain such repeated trials. Therefore, we present a 
      data-driven method that takes advantage of the knowledge of the presented 
      stimulus, to achieve a joint noise reduction and dimensionality reduction without 
      the need for repeated trials. The method first estimates the stimulus-driven 
      neural response using the given stimulus, which is then used to find a set of 
      spatial filters that maximize the SNR based on a generalized eigenvalue 
      decomposition. As the method is fully data-driven, the dimensionality reduction 
      enables researchers to perform their analyses without having to rely on their 
      knowledge of brain regions of interest, which increases accuracy and reduces the 
      human factor in the results. In the context of neural tracking of a speech 
      stimulus using EEG, our method resulted in more accurate short-term temporal 
      response function (TRF) estimates, higher correlations between predicted and 
      actual neural responses, and higher attention decoding accuracies compared to 
      existing TRF-based decoding methods. We also provide an extensive discussion on 
      the central role played by the generalized eigenvalue decomposition in various 
      denoising methods in the literature, and address the conceptual similarities and 
      differences with our proposed method.

TI  - EEG Artifact Removal in TMS Studies of Cortical Speech Areas.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1007/s10548-019-00724-w [doi]
AB  - The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and 
      electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly applied for studying the effective 
      connectivity of neuronal circuits. The stimulation excites neurons, and the 
      resulting TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) are recorded with EEG. A serious obstacle 
      in this method is the generation of large muscle artifacts from scalp muscles, 
      especially when frontolateral and temporoparietal, such as speech, areas are 
      stimulated. Here, TMS-EEG data were processed with the signal-space projection 
      and source-informed reconstruction (SSP-SIR) artifact-removal methods to suppress 
      these artifacts. SSP-SIR suppressed muscle artifacts according to the difference 
      in frequency contents of neuronal signals and muscle activity. The effectiveness 
      of SSP-SIR in rejecting muscle artifacts and the degree of excessive attenuation 
      of brain EEG signals were investigated by comparing the processed versions of the 
      recorded TMS-EEG data with simulated data. The calculated individual lead-field 
      matrix describing how the brain signals spread on the cortex were used as 
      simulated data. We conclude that SSP-SIR was effective in suppressing artifacts 
      also when frontolateral and temporoparietal cortical sites were stimulated, but 
      it may have suppressed also the brain signals near the stimulation site. 
      Effective connectivity originating from the speech-related areas may be studied 
      even when speech areas are stimulated at least on the contralateral hemisphere 
      where the signals were not suppressed that much.

TI  - Removal of EMG Artifacts from Multichannel EEG Signals Using Combined Singular 
      Spectrum Analysis and Canonical Correlation Analysis.
PG  - 4159676
LID - 10.1155/2019/4159676 [doi]
LID - 4159676
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) signals collected from human scalps are often 
      polluted by diverse artifacts, for instance electromyogram (EMG), 
      electrooculogram (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) artifacts. Muscle artifacts 
      are particularly difficult to eliminate among all kinds of artifacts due to their 
      complexity. At present, several researchers have proved the superiority of 
      combining single-channel decomposition algorithms with blind source separation 
      (BSS) to make multichannel EEG recordings free from EMG contamination. In our 
      study, we come up with a novel and valid method to accomplish muscle artifact 
      removal from EEG by using the combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and 
      canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which is named as SSA-CCA. Unlike the 
      traditional single-channel decomposition methods, for example, ensemble empirical 
      mode decomposition (EEMD), SSA algorithm is a technique based on principles of 
      multivariate statistics. Our proposed approach can take advantage of SSA as well 
      as cross-channel information. The performance of SSA-CCA is evaluated on 
      semisimulated and real data. The results demonstrate that this method outperforms 
      the state-of-the-art technique, EEMD-CCA, and the classic technique, CCA, under 
      multichannel circumstances.

AB  - This study expores neural activity underlying creative processes through the 
      investigation of music improvisation. Fourteen guitar players with a high level 
      of improvisation skill participated in this experiment. The experimental task 
      involved playing 32-s alternating blocks of improvisation and scales on guitar. 
      electroencephalography (EEG) data was measured continuously throughout the 
      experiment. In order to remove potential artifacts and extract brain-related 
      activity the following signal processing techniques were employed: bandpass 
      filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction, and Independent Component Analysis 
      (ICA). For each participant, artifact related independent components (ICs) were 
      removed from the EEG data and only ICs found to be from brain activity were 
      retained. Source localization using this brain-related activity was carried out 
      using sLORETA. Greater activity for improvisation over scale was found in 
      multiple frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) localized primarily in the 
      medial frontal cortex (MFC), Middle frontal gyrus (MFG), anterior cingulate, 
      polar medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), premotor cortex (PMC), pre and postcentral 
      gyrus (PreCG and PostCG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule 
      (IPL), and the temporal-parietal junction. Together this collection of brain 
      regions suggests that improvisation was mediated by processes involved in 
      coordinating planned sequences of movement that are modulated in response to 
      ongoing environmental context through monitoring and feedback of sensory states 
      in relation to internal plans and goals. Machine-learning using Common Spatial 
      Patterns (CSP) for EEG feature extraction attained a mean of over 75% 
      classification performance for improvisation vs. scale conditions across 
      participants. These machine-learning results are a step towards the development

TI  - Improved EOG Artifact Removal Using Wavelet Enhanced Independent Component 
      Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9120355 [doi]
LID - 355
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently contaminated with unwanted 
      electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts. Blinks and eye movements generate large 
      amplitude peaks that corrupt EEG measurements. Independent component analysis 
      (ICA) has been used extensively in manual and automatic methods to remove 
      artifacts. By decomposing the signals into neural and artifactual components and 
      artifact components can be eliminated before signal reconstruction. 
      Unfortunately, removing entire components may result in losing important neural 
      information present in the component and eventually may distort the spectral 
      characteristics of the reconstructed signals. An alternative approach is to 
      correct artifacts within the independent components instead of rejecting the 
      entire component, for which wavelet transform based decomposition methods have 
      been used with good results. An improved, fully automatic wavelet-based component 
      correction method is presented for EOG artifact removal that corrects EOG 
      components selectively, i.e., within EOG activity regions only, leaving other 
      parts of the component untouched. In addition, the method does not rely on 
      reference EOG channels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms 
      other component rejection and wavelet-based EOG removal methods in its accuracy 
      both in the time and the spectral domain. The proposed new method represents an 
      important step towards the development of accurate, reliable and automatic EOG 
      artifact removal methods.

TI  - Low Complexity Automatic Stationary Wavelet Transform for Elimination of Eye 
      Blinks from EEG.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9120352 [doi]
LID - 352
AB  - The electroencephalogram signal (EEG) often suffers from various artifacts and 
      noises that have physiological and non-physiological origins. Among these 
      artifacts, eye blink, due to its amplitude is considered to have the most 
      influence on EEG analysis. In this paper, a low complexity approach based on 
      Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and skewness is proposed to remove eye blink 
      artifacts from EEG signals. The proposed method is compared against Automatic 
      Wavelet Independent Components Analysis (AWICA) and Enhanced AWICA. Normalized 
      Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and 
      correlation coefficient ( ρ ) between filtered and pure EEG signals are utilized 
      to quantify artifact removal performance. The proposed approach shows smaller 
      NRMSE, larger PSNR, and larger correlation coefficient values compared to the 
      other methods. Furthermore, the speed of execution of the proposed method is 
      considerably faster than other methods, which makes it more suitable for 
      real-time processing.

TI  - Differences in motivation during the bench press movement with progressive loads 
      using EEG analysis.
PG  - 351-356
LID - 10.5114/biolsport.2019.88757 [doi]
AB  - Considering our preliminary research with EEG analysis of the bench press in 
      experienced powerlifters, we hypothesized that there would be significant 
      differences in motivation between novice and elite powerlifters. Therefore the 
      main objective of this study was to identify patterns of frontal alpha asymmetry 
      (FAA) of the prime movers by alpha frequency band analysis (named as alpha 
      motivation values) for each 35-100% one-repetition maximum (1RM) during the flat 
      bench press. Ten novice powerlifters with no more than 2.5 years of resistance 
      training experience and ten elite powerlifters with at least 7.5 years of 
      training experience participated in the study. All participants were required to 
      squat, bench press, and deadlift 100, 125, and 150% of their body mass, 
      respectively. The athletes constituted a homogeneous group with respect to age 
      (mean 22.3 ± 0.5 years). The EEG recordings were conducted using automatic 
      headcups with 19 electrodes that were placed according to the International 10-20 
      Electrode Placement System. Signals from 8-12 Hz considering points F3 and F4 
      were analyzed. Furthermore, electromyographic (EMG) signals from the trapezius 
      muscle were recorded. Before testing, moods and emotions of subjects were 
      assessed to eliminate subjects with intense emotions. The results showed brain 
      activity before, during and after cognitive and motor performance using 
      electroencephalography (EEG). However, considering the still existing problems of 
      movement artefacts during EEG measurements, eligible sports and exercises are 
      limited to those that are relatively motionless during execution. Further studies 
      are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  - Intra-individual stability of NREM sleep quantitative EEG measures in obstructive 
      sleep apnea.
PG  - e12838
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12838 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalography is collected routinely during clinical polysomnography, 
      but is often utilised to simply determine sleep time to calculate apnea-hypopnea 
      indices. Quantitative analysis of these data (quantitative electroencephalogram) 
      may provide trait-like information to predict patient vulnerability to 
      sleepiness. Measurements of trait-like characteristics need to have high 
      test-retest reliability. We aimed to investigate the intra-individual stability 
      of slow-wave (delta power) and spindle frequency (sigma power) activity during 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. We 
      recorded sleep electroencephalograms during two overnight polysomnographic 
      recordings in 61 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (median days between 
      studies 47, inter-quartile range 53). Electroencephalograms recorded at C3-M2 
      derivation were quantitatively analysed using power spectral analysis following 
      artefact removal. Relative delta (0.5-4.5 Hz) and sigma (12-15 Hz) power during 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep were calculated. Intra-class correlation 
      coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between nights. 
      Intra-class correlation coefficients demonstrated good-to-excellent agreement in 
      the delta and sigma frequencies between nights (intra-class correlation 
      coefficients: 0.84, 0.89, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis of delta power 
      showed a mean difference close to zero (-0.4, 95% limits of agreement -9.4, 8.7) 
      and no heteroscedasticity with increasing power. Sigma power demonstrated 
      heteroscedasticity, with reduced stability as sigma power increased. The mean 
      difference of sigma power between nights was close to zero (0.1, 95% limits -1.6, 
      1.8). We have demonstrated the stability of slow-wave and spindle frequency 
      electroencephalograms during non-rapid eye movement sleep within patients with 
      obstructive sleep apnea. The electroencephalogram profile during non-rapid eye 
      movement sleep may be a useful biomarker for predicting vulnerability to daytime 
      impairment in obstructive sleep apnea and responsiveness to treatment.

TI  - Peak Detection with Online Electroencephalography (EEG) Artifact Removal for 
      Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Purposes.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9120347 [doi]
LID - 347
AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) measure brain activity and translate it to 
      control computer programs or external devices. However, the activity generated by 
      the BCI makes measurements for objective fatigue evaluation very difficult, and 
      the situation is further complicated due to different movement artefacts. The BCI 
      performance could be increased if an online method existed to measure the fatigue 
      objectively and accurately. While BCI-users are moving, a novel automatic online 
      artefact removal technique is used to filter out these movement artefacts. The 
      effects of this filter on BCI performance and mainly on peak frequency detection 
      during BCI use were investigated in this paper. A successful peak alpha frequency 
      measurement can lead to more accurately determining objective user fatigue. 
      Fifteen subjects performed various imaginary and actual movements in separate 
      tasks, while fourteen electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were used. 
      Afterwards, a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI speller was 
      used, and the users were instructed to perform various movements. An offline 
      curve fitting method was used for alpha peak detection to assess the effect of 
      the artefact filtering. Peak detection was improved by the filter, by finding 
      10.91% and 9.68% more alpha peaks during simple EEG recordings and BCI use, 
      respectively. As expected, BCI performance deteriorated from movements, and also 
      from artefact removal. Average information transfer rates (ITRs) were 20.27 
      bit/min, 16.96 bit/min, and 14.14 bit/min for the (1) movement-free, (2) the 
      moving and unfiltered, and (3) the moving and filtered scenarios, respectively.

AB  - Affective human-robot interaction requires lightweight software and cheap 
      wearable devices that could further this field. However, the estimation of 
      emotions in real-time poses a problem that has not yet been optimized. An 
      optimization is proposed for the emotion estimation methodology including 
      artifact removal, feature extraction, feature smoothing, and brain pattern 
      classification. The challenge of filtering artifacts and extracting features, 
      while reducing processing time and maintaining high accuracy results, is 
      attempted in this work. First, two different approaches for real-time 
      electro-oculographic artifact removal techniques are tested and compared in terms 
      of loss of information and processing time. Second, an emotion estimation 
      methodology is proposed based on a set of stable and meaningful features, a 
      carefully chosen set of electrodes, and the smoothing of the feature space. The 
      methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high 
      accuracy on emotion estimation on the SEED database, both under subject dependent 
      and subject independent paradigms, to test the methodology on a discrete 
      emotional model with three affective states.

TI  - Classification of Motor Functions from Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signals Based 
      on an Integrated Method Comprised of Common Spatial Pattern and Wavelet Transform 
      Framework.
LID - 10.3390/s19224878 [doi]
LID - 4878
AB  - In this work, an algorithm for the classification of six motor functions from an 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signal that combines a common spatial pattern (CSP) 
      filter and a continuous wavelet transform (CWT), is investigated. The EEG data 
      comprise six grasp-and-lift events, which are used to investigate the potential 
      of using EEG as input signals with brain computer interface devices for 
      controlling prosthetic devices for upper limb movement. Selected EEG channels are 
      the ones located over the motor cortex, C3, Cz and C4, as well as at the parietal 
      region, P3, Pz and P4. In general, the proposed algorithm includes three main 
      stages, band pass filtering, CSP filtering, and wavelet transform and training on 
      GoogLeNet for feature extraction, feature learning and classification. The band 
      pass filtering is performed to select the EEG signal in the band of 7 Hz to 30 Hz 
      while eliminating artifacts related to eye blink, heartbeat and muscle movement. 
      The CSP filtering is applied on two-class EEG signals that will result in 
      maximizing the power difference between the two-class dataset. Since CSP is 
      mathematically developed for two-class events, the extension to the multiclass 
      paradigm is achieved by using the approach of one class versus all other classes. 
      Subsequently, continuous wavelet transform is used to convert the band pass and 
      CSP filtered signals from selected electrodes to scalograms which are then 
      converted to images in grayscale format. The three scalograms from the motor 
      cortex regions and the parietal region are then combined to form two sets of RGB 
      images. Next, these RGB images become the input to GoogLeNet for classification 
      of the motor EEG signals. The performance of the proposed classification 
      algorithm is evaluated in terms of precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy 
      with average values of 94.8%, 93.5%, 94.7%, 94.1%, respectively, and average area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve equal to 0.985. These 
      results indicate a good performance of the proposed algorithm in classifying 
      grasp-and-lift events from EEG signals.

TI  - Cardiac biomarkers associated with epilepsy in a captive baboon pedigree.
PG  - e110-e114
LID - 10.1111/epi.16359 [doi]
AB  - The epileptic baboon provides a natural model of idiopathic generalized epilepsy 
      and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This retrospective, 
      case-controlled study aims to evaluate cardiac biomarkers of epilepsy, 
      specifically QT-interval prolongation and heart rate variability (HRV), in 
      pedigreed, captive baboons undergoing scalp electroencephalography (EEG). We 
      retrospectively identified 21 epileptic (nine females, mean age = 
      11.4 ± 5.4 years) and 19 asymptomatic control (12 females, mean age = 
      10.5 ± 6.3 years) baboons, who had undergone scalp EEG studies with an 
      artifact-free, 10-beat electrocardiogram sample. All baboons were sedated with 
      subanesthetic doses of ketamine prior to electrode placement. PR, QT, and RR 
      intervals were measured, and Fridericia-corrected QT duration (QTcF) and root 
      mean square of successive differences between RR intervals (RMSSD; representative 
      of HRV) values were compared between the groups. The epilepsy group had 
      significantly prolonged QT and QTcF intervals (P = .005) compared to controls. 
      RMSSD values were nonsignificantly decreased in epileptic baboons compared to the 
      control group. This study demonstrates cardiac repolarization anomalies and 
      reduction of HRV in epileptic baboons, providing new cardiac biomarkers in 
      pedigreed baboons and potential risk factors for SUDEP.

TI  - Artifacts in Simultaneous hdEEG/fMRI Imaging: A Nonlinear Dimensionality 
      Reduction Approach.
LID - 10.3390/s19204454 [doi]
LID - 4454
AB  - Simultaneous recordings of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) are at the forefront of technologies of interest to 
      physicians and scientists because they combine the benefits of both 
      modalities-better time resolution (hdEEG) and space resolution (fMRI). However, 
      EEG measurements in the scanner contain an electromagnetic field that is induced 
      in leads as a result of gradient switching slight head movements and vibrations, 
      and it is corrupted by changes in the measured potential because of the Hall 
      phenomenon. The aim of this study is to design and test a methodology for 
      inspecting hidden EEG structures with respect to artifacts. We propose a top-down 
      strategy to obtain additional information that is not visible in a single 
      recording. The time-domain independent component analysis algorithm was employed 
      to obtain independent components and spatial weights. A nonlinear dimension 
      reduction technique t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding was used to 
      create low-dimensional space, which was then partitioned using the density-based 
      spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The relationships between 
      the found data structure and the used criteria were investigated. As a result, we 
      were able to extract information from the data structure regarding 
      electrooculographic, electrocardiographic, electromyographic and gradient 
      artifacts. This new methodology could facilitate the identification of artifacts 
      and their residues from simultaneous EEG in fMRI.

TI  - Automatic eye blink artifact removal for EEG based on a sparse coding technique 
      for assessing major mental disorders.
PG  - 217-229
LID - 10.31083/j.jin.2019.03.164 [doi]
AB  - In the electroencephalogram recorded data are often confounded with artifacts, 
      especially in the case of eye blinks. Different methods for artifact detection 
      and removal are discussed in the literature, including automatic detection and 
      removal. Here, an automatic method of eye blink detection and correction is 
      proposed where sparse coding is used for an electroencephalogram dataset. In this 
      method, a hybrid dictionary based on a ridgelet transformation is used to capture 
      prominent features by analyzing independent components extracted from a different 
      number of electroencephalogram channels. In this study, the proposed method has 
      been tested and validated with five different datasets for artifact detection and 
      correction. Results show that the proposed technique is promising as it 
      successfully extracted the exact locations of eye blinking artifacts. The 
      accuracy of the method (automatic detection) is 89.6% which represents a better 
      estimate than that obtained by an extreme machine learning classifier.

AB  - Novel state-of-the-art amplifier and cap systems enable Electroencephalography 
      (EEG) recording outside of stationary lab systems during physical exercise and 
      body motion. However, extensive preparation time, cleaning, and limited long-term 
      stability of conventional gel-based electrode systems pose significant 
      limitations in out-of-the-lab conditions. Dry electrode systems may contribute to 
      rapid and repetitive mobile EEG acquisition with significantly reduced 
      preparation time, reduced cleaning requirements, and possible self-application by 
      the volunteer but are known for higher channel failure probability and increased 
      sensitivity to movement artifacts. We performed a counterbalanced repeated 
      measure endurance cycling study to objectively validate the performance and 
      applicability of a novel commercially available 64-channel dry electrode cap for 
      sport science. A total of 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, 
      performing an endurance cycling paradigm comprising five phases: (I) baseline 
      EEG, (II) pre-cycling EEG, (III) endurance cycling, (IV) active recovery, and (V) 
      passive recovery. We compared the performance of the 64-channel dry electrode cap 
      with a commercial gel-based cap system in terms of usability metrics, 
      reliability, and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we validated the 
      performance of the dry cap during a realistic sport science investigation, 
      verifying the hypothesis of a systematic, reproducible shift of the individual 
      alpha peak frequency (iAPF) induced by physical effort. The average preparation 
      time of the dry cap was one-third of the gel-based electrode caps. The average 
      channel reliability of the dry cap varied between 80 ± 15% (Phase I), 66 ± 19% 
      (Phase III), and 91 ± 10% (Phase V). In comparison, the channel reliability of 
      the gel-based cap varied between 95 ± 3, 85 ± 9, and 82 ± 9%, respectively. No 
      considerable differences were evident for the comfort evaluations nor the signal 
      characteristics of both caps. A within-volunteers repeated measure analysis of 
      variance (RM-ANOVA) did not show significant effects of the electrode type on the 
      iAPF [F(1,12) = 1.670, p = 0.221, ηp2 = 0.122, Power = 0.222]. However, a 
      significant increase of the iAPF exists from Phase II to Phases IV and V due to 
      exhaustive physical task. In conclusion, we demonstrated that dry electrode cap 
      is equivalent to the gel-based electrode cap based on signal characteristics, 
      comfort, and signal information content, thereby confirming the usefulness of dry 
      electrodes in sports science and other mobile applications involving ample 
      movement.

TI  - Evaluating Mental Load During Realistic Driving Simulations by Means of Round the 
      Ear Electrodes.
PG  - 940

AB  - Film based round the ear electrodes (cEEGrids) provide both, the accessibility of 
      unobtrusive mobile EEG as well as a rapid EEG application in stationary settings 
      when extended measurements are not possible. In a large-scale evaluation of 
      driving abilities of older adults (N > 350) in a realistic driving simulation, we 
      evaluated to what extent mental demands can be measured using cEEGrids in a 
      completely unrestricted environment. For a first frequency-based analysis, the 
      driving scenario was subdivided into different street segments with respect to 
      their task loads (low, medium, high) that was a priori rated by an expert. Theta 
      activity increased with task load but no change in Alpha power was found. Effects 
      gained clarity after removing pink noise effects, that were potentially high in 
      this data set due to motion artifacts. Theta fraction increased with task load 
      and Alpha fraction decreased. We mapped this effect to specific street segments 
      by applying a track-frequency analysis. Whilst participants drove with constant 
      speed and without high steering wheel activity, Alpha was high and theta low. The 
      reverse was the case in sections that required either high activity or increased 
      attentional allocation to the driving context. When calculating mental demands 
      for different street segments based on EEG, this measure is highly significant 
      correlated with the experts' rating of task load. Deviances can be explained by 
      specific features within the segments. Thus, modulations in spectral power of the 
      EEG were validly reflected in the cEEGrids data. All findings were in line with 
      the prominent literature in the field. The results clearly demonstrate the 
      usability of this low-density EEG method for application in real-world settings 
      where an increase in ecological validity might outweigh the loss of certain 
      aspects of internal validity.

TI  - The Sensitivity of Single-Trial Mu-Suppression Detection for Motor Imagery 
      Performance as Compared to Motor Execution and Motor Observation Performance.
PG  - 302

AB  - Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used to operate brain-computer interface (BCI) 
      systems for rehabilitation and some life assistive devices. However, the current 
      performance of an MI-based BCI cannot fully meet the needs of its in-field 
      applications. Most of the BCIs utilizing a generalized feature for all 
      participants have been found to greatly hamper the efficacy of the BCI system. 
      Hence, some attempts have made on the exploration of subject-dependent 
      parameters, but it remains challenging to enhance BCI performance as expected. To 
      this end, in this study, we used the independent component analysis (ICA), which 
      has been proved capable of isolating the pure motor-related component from 
      non-motor-related brain processes and artifacts and extracting the common 
      motor-related component across MI, motor execution (ME), and motor observation 
      (MO) conditions. Then, a sliding window approach was used to detect significant 
      mu-suppression from the baseline using the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha 
      power time course and, thus, the success rate of the mu-suppression detection 
      could be assessed on a single-trial basis. By comparing the success rates using 
      different parameters, we further quantified the extent of the improvement in each 
      motor condition to evaluate the effectiveness of both generalized and 
      individualized parameters. The results showed that in ME condition, the success 
      rate under individualized latency and that under generalized latency was 90.0% 
      and 77.75%, respectively; in MI condition, the success rate was 74.14% for 
      individual latency and 58.47% for generalized latency, and in MO condition, the 
      success rate was 67.89% and 61.26% for individual and generalized latency, 
      respectively. As can be seen, the success rate in each motor condition was 
      significantly improved by utilizing an individualized latency compared to that 
      using the generalized latency. Moreover, the comparison of the individualized 
      window latencies for the mu-suppression detection across different runs of the 
      same participant as well as across different participants showed that the window 
      latency was significantly more consistent in the intra-subject than in the 
      inter-subject settings. As a result, we proposed that individualizing the latency 
      for detecting the mu-suppression feature for each participant might be a 
      promising attempt to improve the MI-based BCI performance.

AB  - Based on similarity measures in the wavelet domain under a multichannel EEG 
      setting, two new methods are developed for single-trial event-related potential 
      (ERP) detection. The first method, named "multichannel EEG thresholding by 
      similarity" (METS), simultaneously denoises all of the information recorded by 
      the channels. The second approach, named "semblance-based ERP window selection" 
      (SEWS), presents two versions to automatically localize the ERP in time for each 
      subject to reduce the time window to be analysed by removing useless features. We 
      empirically show that when these methods are used independently, they are 
      suitable for ERP denoising and feature extraction. Meanwhile, the combination of 
      both methods obtains better results compared to using them independently. The 
      denoising algorithm was compared with classic thresholding methods based on 
      wavelets and was found to obtain better results, which shows its suitability for 
      ERP processing. The combination of the two algorithms for denoising the signals 
      and selecting the time window has been compared to xDAWN, which is an efficient 
      algorithm to enhance ERPs. We conclude that our wavelet-based semblance method 
      performs better than xDAWN for single-trial detection in the presence of 
      artifacts or noise.

AB  - The evaluation of building facades is one of the most important elements in built 
      environments for helping architects and professionals to develop future designs. 
      The form or shape of windows in building facades has direct impacts on 
      perceivers' affective state and emotions. To understand the impacts of geometric 
      windows on the subject's feedback and cortical activity, psychophysics 
      experiments and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were measured from the 
      participants. Our behavioral results show a distinguished categorization of the 
      window shapes as pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. The rectangular, square, 
      circular and semi-circular arch were determined as the pleasant window shapes, 
      while the triangular and triangular arch window shapes were distinguished as 
      unpleasant. Furthermore, event-related potential (ERP) components (N1, P2 and P3) 
      were investigated to determine the influence of window shapes on the local brain 
      activity. To measure reliable cortical responses, a Butterworth notch filter (50 
      Hz), band pass filter (0.1-60 Hz) and ADJUST filter were employed to remove the 
      artifacts. The electrophysiological results show increased activity for the 
      unpleasant in comparison to the pleasant windows (p < 0.05, Rank-Sum test) in 
      both frontal (for P2 component) and posterio-occipital (ERP amplitudes; the N1 
      through to the P3 peak) channels. The ERP amplitudes of the right hemisphere were 
      significantly larger than in the left hemisphere, not only in response to the 
      unpleasant (p < 0.001) but also to the pleasant window stimuli (p < 0.001, 
      Signed-Rank test). However, the unpleasant stimuli evoked significantly larger 
      ERP amplitude than the pleasant stimuli. Moreover, the significant ERP(P2) 
      amplitude was more distinguished for unpleasant (p = 0.01, Signed-Rank test) than 
      pleasant windows (p = 0.01, Rank-Sum test) between frontal and central cortical 
      lobes. Overall, our behavioral and electrophysiological studies demonstrate a 
      distinguished categorization of pleasant and unpleasant window shapes and more 
      significant ERP modulations in the right than left hemisphere for unpleasant 
      windows compared to pleasant ones.

AB  - We present a patient with tonic seizures of the bulbar muscles. Video-EEG 
      recording during the multiple attacks showed no ictal EEG abnormalities. The 
      tonic seizures were clearly visible as EMG artefacts on the EEG recording and 
      consisted of 3-6 symmetric tonic bursts of EMG activity of 2-4 seconds and an 
      interval of 2-6 seconds. Spectral analysis showed a very distinct, bilateral 
      synchronous, dominant gamma peak on the EMG spectra during the seizures with a 
      cross correlation of 0.67 between left and right without a time lag. We discuss 
      whether this peak originates from the firing frequencies of the bulbar motor 
      units, and whether this is consistent with the Piper rhythm described during 
      maximal voluntary contraction in controls and related to firing in the gamma 
      range of the cortical motor neurons. We conclude that the EMG artefacts recorded 
      on EEG during seizures can be informative with regards to the type and 
      pathophysiology of epilepsy.

AB  - Previous work has suggested that evoked potential analysis might allow the 
      detection of subjects with new-onset Alzheimer's disease, which would be useful 
      clinically and personally. Here, it is described how subjects with new-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease have been differentiated from healthy, normal subjects to 
      100% accuracy, based on the back-projected independent components (BICs) of the 
      P300 peak at the electroencephalogram electrodes in the response to an oddball, 
      auditory-evoked potential paradigm. After artifact removal, clustering, 
      selection, and normalization processes, the BICs were classified using a neural 
      network, a Bayes classifier, and a voting strategy. The technique is general and 
      might be applied for presymptomatic detection and to other conditions and evoked 
      potentials, although further validation with more subjects, preferably in 
      multicenter studies is recommended.

TI  - NREM sleep EEG slow waves in autistic and typically developing children: 
      Morphological characteristics and scalp distribution.
PG  - e12775
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12775 [doi]
AB  - Autism is a developmental disorder with a neurobiological aetiology. Studies of 
      the autistic brain identified atypical developmental trajectories that may lead 
      to an impaired capacity to modulate electroencephalogram activity during sleep. 
      We assessed the topography and characteristics of non-rapid eye movement sleep 
      electroencephalogram slow waves in 26 boys aged between 6 and 13 years old: 13 
      with an autism spectrum disorder and 13 typically developing. None of the 
      participants was medicated, intellectually disabled, reported poor sleep, or 
      suffered from medical co-morbidities. Results are derived from a second 
      consecutive night of polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. Slow waves 
      (0.3-4.0 Hz; >75 µV) were automatically detected on artefact-free sections of 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep along the anteroposterior axis in frontal, central, 
      parietal and occipital derivations. Slow wave density (number per minute), 
      amplitude (µV), slope (µV s(-1) ) and duration (s) were computed for the first 
      four non-rapid eye movement periods. Slow wave characteristics comparisons 
      between groups, derivations and non-rapid eye movement periods were assessed with 
      three-way mixed ANOVAs. Slow wave density, amplitude, slope and duration were 
      higher in anterior compared with most posterior derivations in both groups. 
      Children with autism spectrum disorder showed lower differences in slow waves 
      between recording sites along the anteroposterior axis than typically developing 
      children. These group differences in the topography of slow wave characteristics 
      were stable across the night. We propose that slow waves during non-rapid eye 
      movement sleep could be an electrophysiological marker of the deviant cortical 
      maturation in autism linked to an atypical functioning of thalamo-cortical 
      networks.

AB  - Advancements in acquisition technology and signal-processing techniques have 
      spurred numerous recent investigations on the electro-cortical signals generated 
      during whole-body motion. This approach, termed Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), 
      has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive 
      processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no 
      one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) 
      recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study 
      was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while 
      walking. High-density EEG was acquired from 12 young adults on two occasions, 
      separated by an average of 2.3years, as they performed a Go/No-Go response 
      inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task 
      while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we focused on two well-established 
      neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following 
      ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of 
      reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 
      component were generally less robust but still indicative of adequate to good 
      levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking 
      sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In 
      contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during 
      sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical 
      signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of 
      neurophysiological function.

AB  - Eye movements are an integral part of human perception, but can induce artifacts 
      in many magneto-encephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies. 
      For this reason, investigators try to minimize eye movements and remove these 
      artifacts from their data using different techniques. When these artifacts are 
      not purely random, but consistent regarding certain stimuli or conditions, the 
      possibility arises that eye movements are actually inducing effects in the MEG 
      signal. It remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on 
      observed effects in MEG, since most MEG studies lack a control analysis to verify 
      whether an effect found in the MEG signal is induced by eye movements. Here, we 
      find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different 
      stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of 
      research typically done with MEG. This means that the observed MEG effect might 
      be (partly) due to eye movements instead of any true neural correlate. We suggest 
      how to check for eye movement effects in the data and make suggestions on how to 
      minimize eye movement artifacts from occurring in the first place.

      on the Gradient Artifact.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      experiments are contaminated by large gradient artifacts (GA). The amplitude of 
      the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as 
      on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for 
      MR imaging. Average artifact subtraction (AAS), the most commonly used method for 
      GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to 
      characterize the artifact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is 
      generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, 
      but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during 
      acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the 
      ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant 
      contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective 
      wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon 
      cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root 
      mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancelation of the cap 
      and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 
      m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution 
      coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ∼ 1.6 and by a 
      factor of ∼ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could 
      potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an 
      increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution 
      without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI 
      studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small 
      subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.

AB  - Brain computer interfaces are currently considered to greatly enhance assistive 
      technologies and improve the experiences of people with special needs in the 
      workplace. The proposed adaptive control model for smart offices provides a 
      complete prototype that senses an environment's temperature and lighting and 
      responds to users' feelings in terms of their comfort and engagement levels. The 
      model comprises the following components: (a) sensors to sense the environment, 
      including temperature and brightness sensors, and a headset that collects 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which represent workers' comfort levels; (b) 
      an application that analyzes workers' feelings regarding their willingness to 
      adjust to a space based on an analysis of collected data and that determines 
      workers' attention levels and, thus, engagement; and (c) actuators to adjust the 
      temperature and/or lighting. This research implemented independent component 
      analysis to remove eye movement artifacts from the EEG signals and used an 
      engagement index to calculate engagement levels. This research is expected to add 
      value to research on smart city infrastructures and on assistive technologies to 
      increase productivity in smart offices.

AB  - Across biomedical areas, there is a significant unmet need for multimodal 
      biomarkers that can improve prediction of abnormal events such as seizures, heart 
      and asthma attacks or stroke. These markers may be multimodal and may include 
      electrophysiological measures estimated from noninvasive, routinely collected 
      clinical data, such as electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiograms (ECG). 
      In epilepsy, seizure detection and prediction from noninvasive data remains a 
      difficult problem in need of novel approaches and markers. The inherent noise in 
      high-dimensional EEG signals and artifact contamination often severely impacts 
      the sensitivity and specificity of otherwise promising biomarkers. Long-term 
      epilepsy clinical studies typically collect continuous ECG from which additional 
      features may be estimated and combined with EEG measures to improve sensitivity 
      to ictogenesis and seizure specificity. Prior work has focused on ventricular 
      activity and features of the QRS complex, but atrial activity may also be 
      modulated by seizure evolution. Given the high dimension of the ECG collected 
      continuously over several days, an entirely data-driven approach is proposed, 
      based on which ECG signals may be separated into ventricular and atrial 
      contributions and studied separately. The relationship of atrial dynamics to 
      seizure occurrence is assessed in a small number of pediatric epilepsy patients 
      with high-dimensional ECG.

      D. Lhatoo, MD, FRCP. Neurology. 2019;92:e171-e182. OBJECTIVE: To characterize 
      peri-ictal apnea and postictal asystole in generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) 
      of intractable epilepsy. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter epilepsy 
      monitoring study of autonomic and breathing biomarkers of sudden unexpected death 
      in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients ≥18 years old with intractable epilepsy and 
      monitored GCS. Video electroencephalography, thoracoabdominal excursions, nasal 
      airflow, capillary oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We studied 148 GCS in 87 patients. Nineteen patients had generalized 
      epilepsy, 65 had focal epilepsy, 1 had both, and the epileptogenic zone was 
      unknown in 2. Ictal central apnea (ICA) preceded GCS in 49 (40.4%) of 121 
      seizures in 23 patients, all with focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea 
      (PCCA) occurred in 31 (22.1%) of 140 seizures in 22 patients, with generalized, 
      focal, or unknown epileptogenic zones. In 2 patients, PCCA occurred concurrently 
      with asystole (near-SUDEP), with an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1000 
      patient-years. One patient with PCCA died of probable SUDEP during follow-up, 
      suggesting a SUDEP incidence rate 5.1 per 1000 patient-years. No cases of 
      laryngospasm were detected. Rhythmic muscle artifact synchronous with breathing 
      was present in 75 of 147 seizures and related to stertorous breathing (odds 
      ratio: 3.856, 95% confidence interval: 1.395-10.663, P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Postconvulsive central apnea occurred in both focal and generalized epilepsies, 
      suggesting a different pathophysiology from ICA, which occurred only in focal 
      epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea was seen in 2 near-SUDEP cases and 1 
      probable SUDEP case, suggesting that this phenomenon may serve as a clinical 
      biomarker of SUDEP. Larger studies are needed to validate this observation. 
      Rhythmic postictal muscle artifact is suggestive of post-GCS breathing effort 
      rather than a specific biomarker of laryngospasm. Hypoxemia Following Generalized

      occurrence or severity of postictal hypoxemia in the immediate aftermath of a 
      generalized convulsive seizure (GCS). METHODS: We reviewed the video 
      electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 1006 patients with drug-resistant 
      focal epilepsy included in the REPO2MSE study to identify those with ≥1 GCS and 
      pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) measurement. Factors determining recovery of SpO(2) ≥ 90% 
      were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Association between 
      SpO(2) nadir and person- or seizure-specific variables was analyzed after 
      correction for individual effects and the varying number of seizures. RESULTS: A 
      total of 107 GCS in 73 patients were analyzed. A transient hypoxemia was observed 
      in 92 (86%) GCS. Rate of GCS with SpO(2) < 70% dropped from 40% to 21% when 
      oxygen was administered early (P = .046). Early recovery of SpO(2) ≥ 90% was 
      associated with early administration of oxygen (P = .004), absence of postictal 
      generalized EEG suppression (PGES; P = .014), and extratemporal lobe epilepsy (P 
      = .001). Lack of early administration of O(2) (P = .003), occurrence of PGES (P = 
      .018), and occurrence of ictal hypoxemia during the focal phase (P = .022) were 
      associated with lower SpO(2) nadir. CONCLUSION: Postictal hypoxemia was observed 
      in the immediate aftermath of nearly all GCS, but administration of oxygen had a 
      strong preventive effect. Severity of postictal hypoxemia was greater in temporal 
      lobe epilepsy and when hypoxemia was already observed before the onset of 
      secondary GCS.

PG  - 1467-1472

AB  - Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) translate brain signals into control signals for 
      an external device, such as a computer cursor or robotic limb. These signals can 
      be obtained either noninvasively or invasively. Invasive recordings, using 
      electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracortical microelectrodes, provide higher 
      bandwidth and more informative signals. Rehabilitative BMIs, which aim to drive 
      plasticity in the brain to enhance recovery after brain injury, have almost 
      exclusively used non-invasive recordings, such electroencephalography (EEG) or 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), which have limited bandwidth and information 
      content. Invasive recordings provide more information and spatiotemporal 
      resolution, but do incur risk, and thus are not usually investigated in people 
      with stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, in this paper, we describe a 
      new BMI paradigm to investigate the use of higher frequency signals in 
      brain-injured subjects without incurring significant risk. We recorded EEG in TBI 
      subjects who required hemicraniectomies (removal of a part of the skull). EEG 
      over the hemicraniectomy (hEEG) contained substantial information in the high 
      gamma frequency range (65-115 Hz). Using this information, we decoded continuous 
      finger flexion force with moderate to high accuracy (variance accounted for 0.06 
      to 0.52), which at best approaches that using epidural signals. These results 
      indicate that people with hemicraniectomies can provide a useful resource for 
      developing BMI therapies for the treatment of brain injury.

AB  - PURPOSE: Eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA) is an epileptic syndrome 
      characterized by eyelid myoclonia with or without absences, eyes closure-induced 
      EEG paroxysms and photosensitivity. Pathophysiological mechanisms of visual 
      sensitivity in EMA are not-fully understood. The objective of the present study 
      was to analyze the electrophysiological dynamics implicated in the visual 
      sensitivity in patients with EMA. METHODS: We analyzed data of 10 subjects with 
      diagnosis of EMA and of 10 healthy control subjects. For both patients and 
      controls, 4-seconds artifacts-free electroencephalographic signal epochs recorded 
      were analyzed, during resting state, eyes-opened and eyes-closed tasks. Resting 
      state networks in EEG have been computed using independent components analysis 
      (ICA) LORETA. Moreover, the power law exponent β was obtained for each coordinate 
      as minus the slope of the power spectrum versus frequency in a Log-Log scale. 
      RESULTS: Using LORETA ICA, patients during resting state showed significant 
      differences as compared to controls with a reduction of the physiological alpha 
      activity over the occipital lobe and of the physiological beta activity over the 
      frontal lobe. Immediately after eye closure, a significant increase of beta 
      activity over the frontal lobe was found in the group of patients compared to 
      controls. Power law exponent β analysis showed a significant increase of β over 
      the frontal regions in patients as compared to controls during resting-state and 
      an increase of β over the parieto-occipital regions after eye closure. 
      CONCLUSION: Abnormal occipital and frontal cortex activities seem to be related 
      with the visual sensitivity and eyelid myoclonia observed in patients with EMA.

TI  - The Statistics of EEG Unipolar References: Derivations and Properties.
PG  - 696-703
LID - 10.1007/s10548-019-00706-y [doi]
AB  - In this brief communication, which complements the EEG reference review (Yao et 
      al. in Brain Topogr, 2019), we provide the mathematical derivations that show: 
      (1) any EEG reference admits the general form of a linear transformation of the 
      ideal multichannel EEG potentials with reference to infinity; (2) the average 
      reference (AR), the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), and its 
      regularized version (rREST) are solving the linear inverse problems that can be 
      derived from both the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the Bayesian theory; 
      however, REST is based on more informative prior/constraint of volume conduction 
      than that of AR; (3) we show for the first time that REST is also a unipolar 
      reference (UR), allowing us to define a general family of URs with unified 
      notations; (4) some notable properties of URs are 'no memory', 'rank deficient by 
      1', and 'orthogonal projector centering'; (5) we also point out here, for the 
      first time, that rREST provides the optimal interpolating function that can be 
      used when the reference channel is missing or the 'bad' channels are rejected. 
      The derivations and properties imply that: (a) any two URs can transform to each 
      other and referencing with URs multiple times will not accumulate artifacts; (b) 
      whatever URs the EEG data was previously transformed with, the minimum norm 
      solution to the reference problem will be REST and AR with and without modeling 
      volume conduction, respectively; (c) the MLE and the Bayesian theory show the 
      theoretical optimality of REST. The advantages and limitations of AR and REST are 
      discussed to guide readers for their proper use.

TI  - High Frequency Oscillations in Epilepsy: Detection Methods and Considerations in 
      Clinical Application.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.14581/jer.19001 [doi]
AB  - High frequency oscillations (HFOs) is a brain activity observed in 
      electroencephalography (EEG) in frequency ranges between 80-500 Hz. HFOs can be 
      classified into ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (200-500 Hz) by their 
      distinctive characteristics. Recent studies reported that both ripples and fast 
      fipples can be regarded as a new biomarker of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. 
      Previous studies verified that HFOs are clinically important both in patients 
      with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortical epilepsy. Also, in epilepsy 
      surgery, patients with higher resection ratio of brain regions with HFOs showed 
      better outcome than a group with lower resection ratio. For clinical application 
      of HFOs, it is important to delineate HFOs accurately and discriminate them from 
      artifacts. There have been technical improvements in detecting HFOs by developing 
      various detection algorithms. Still, there is a difficult issue on discriminating 
      clinically important HFOs among detected HFOs, where both quantitative and 
      subjective approaches are suggested. This paper is a review on published HFO 
      studies focused on clinical findings and detection techniques of HFOs as well as 
      tips for clinical applications.

TI  - Functional Corticomuscular Signal Coupling Is Weakened during Voluntary Motor 
      Action in Cancer-Related Fatigue.
PG  - 2490750
LID - 10.1155/2019/2490750 [doi]
LID - 2490750
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is widely recognized as one 
      of the most common symptoms and side effects of cancer and/or its treatment. 
      However, neuropathological mechanisms contributing to CRF are largely unknown, 
      and the lack of knowledge makes CRF difficult to treat. Recent research has shown 
      dissociation between changes in the brain and muscle signals during voluntary 
      motor performance in cancer survivors with CRF, and this dissociation may be 
      caused by an interruption in functional coupling (FC) of the two signals. The 
      goal of this study was to assess the FC between EEG (cortical signal) and EMG 
      (muscular signal) in individuals with CRF and compare the FC with that of healthy 
      controls during a motor task that led to progressive muscle fatigue. METHOD: 
      Eight cancer survivors with CRF and nine healthy participants sustained an 
      isometric elbow flexion contraction (at 30% maximal level) until self-perceived 
      exhaustion. The entire duration of the EEG and EMG recordings was divided into 
      the first-half (less-fatigue stage) and second-half (more-fatigue stage) 
      artifact-free epochs without overlapping. The EEG-EMG coupling (measured by 
      coherence of the two signals) in each group and stage was computed. Coherence 
      values at different frequencies were statistically analyzed using a 
      repeated-measure general linear model. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 
      compared to healthy controls, CRF participants sustained the contraction for a 
      significantly shorter time and exhibited robust and significantly lower EEG-EMG 
      coherence at the alpha (8~14 Hz) and beta (15~35 Hz) frequency bands. Both the 
      CRF and healthy control groups exhibited significantly decreased EEG-EMG 
      coherence from the less-fatigue to more-fatigue stages at the alpha and beta 
      frequency bands, indicating fatigue-induced weakening of functional 
      corticomuscular coupling. CONCLUSION: Impaired functional coupling between the 
      brain and muscle signals could be a consequence of cancer and/or its treatment, 
      and it may be one of the contributing factors to the abnormal feeling of fatigue 
      that caused the early failure of sustaining a prolonged motor task.

TI  - L-Dopa Modulation of Brain Connectivity in Parkinson's Disease Patients: A Pilot 
      EEG-fMRI Study.
PG  - 611
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2019.00611 [doi]
LID - 611
AB  - Studies of functional neurosurgery and electroencephalography in Parkinson's 
      disease have demonstrated abnormally synchronous activity between basal ganglia 
      and motor cortex. Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction 
      during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of 
      activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively 
      normalized these functional alterations. The aim of this pilot study was to 
      examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in 
      early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Six patients 
      with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner 
      and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of 
      interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting 
      state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was 
      computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic 
      artifacts. fMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional 
      connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both 
      attention and default mode networks. EEG connectivity among regions of the motor 
      network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network 
      showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain. 
      This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous 
      direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, 
      dorsal attention and default mode networks.

TI  - Analysis of a Low-Cost EEG Monitoring System and Dry Electrodes toward Clinical 
      Use in the Neonatal ICU.
LID - 10.3390/s19112637 [doi]
LID - 2637
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important clinical tool for monitoring 
      neurological health. However, the required equipment, expertise, and patient 
      preparation inhibits its use outside of tertiary care. Non-experts struggle to 
      obtain high-quality EEG due to its low amplitude and artefact susceptibility. Wet 
      electrodes are currently used, which require abrasive/conductive gels to reduce 
      skin-electrode impedance. Advances in dry electrodes, which do not require gels, 
      have simplified this process. However, the assessment of dry electrodes on 
      neonates is limited due to health and safety barriers. This study presents a 
      simulation framework for assessing the quality of EEG systems using a neonatal 
      EEG database, without the use of human participants. The framework is used to 
      evaluate a low-cost EEG acquisition system and compare performance of wet and dry 
      (Micro Transdermal Interface Platforms (MicroTIPs), g.tec-g.SAHARA) electrodes 
      using accurately acquired impedance models. A separate experiment assessing the 
      electrodes on adult participants was conducted to verify the simulation 
      framework's efficacy. Dry electrodes have higher impedance than wet electrodes, 
      causing a reduction in signal quality. However, MicroTIPs perform comparably to 
      wet electrodes at the frontal region and g.tec-g.SAHARA performs well at the 
      occipital region. Using the simulation framework, a 25dB signal-to-noise ratio 
      (SNR) was obtained for the low-cost EEG system. The tests on adults closely 
      matched the simulated results.

TI  - The Effects of Filter's Class, Cutoff Frequencies, and Independent Component 
      Analysis on the Amplitude of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials Recorded from 
      Healthy Volunteers.
LID - 10.3390/s19112610 [doi]
LID - 2610
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different 
      preprocessing parameters on the amplitude of median nerve somatosensory evoked 
      potentials (SEPs). METHODS: Different combinations of two classes of filters 
      (Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)), three cutoff 
      frequency bands (0.5-1000 Hz, 3-1000 Hz, and 30-1000 Hz), and independent 
      component analysis (ICA) were used to preprocess SEPs recorded from 17 healthy 
      volunteers who participated in two sessions of 1000 stimulations of the right 
      median nerve. N30 amplitude was calculated from frontally placed electrode (F3). 
      RESULTS: The epochs classified as artifacts from SEPs filtered with FIR compared 
      to those filtered with IIR were 1% more using automatic and 140% more using 
      semi-automatic methods (both p < 0.001). There were no differences in N30 
      amplitudes between FIR and IIR filtered SEPs. The N30 amplitude was significantly 
      lower for SEPs filtered with 30-1000 Hz compared to the bandpass frequencies 
      0.5-1000 Hz and 3-1000 Hz. The N30 amplitude was significantly reduced when SEPs 
      were cleaned with ICA compared to the SEPs from which non-brain components were 
      not removed using ICA. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the preprocessing of 
      SEPs should be done carefully and the neuroscience community should come to a 
      consensus regarding SEP preprocessing guidelines, as the preprocessing parameters 
      can affect the outcomes that may influence the interpretations of results, 
      replicability, and comparison of different studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of 
      epilepsy. HFOs are typically acquired on intracranial electrodes, but 
      contamination from muscle artifacts is still problematic in HFO analysis. This 
      paper evaluates the effect of myogenic artifacts on intracranial HFO detection 
      and how to remove them. METHODS: Intracranial EEG was recorded in 31 patients. 
      HFOs were detected for the entire recording using an automated algorithm. When 
      available, simultaneous scalp EEG was used to identify periods of muscle 
      artifact. Those markings were used to train an automated scalp EMG detector and 
      an intracranial EMG detector. Specificity to epileptic tissue was evaluated by 
      comparison with seizure onset zone and resected volume in patients with good 
      outcome. RESULTS: EMG artifacts are frequent and produce large numbers of false 
      HFOs, especially in the anterior temporal lobe. The scalp and intracranial EMG 
      detectors both had high accuracy. Removing false HFOs improved specificity to 
      epileptic tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of HFOs requires accounting for the 
      effect of muscle artifact. We present two tools that effectively mitigate the 
      effect of muscle artifact on HFOs. SIGNIFICANCE: Removing muscle artifacts 
      improves the specificity of HFOs to epileptic tissue. Future HFO work should 
      account for this effect, especially when using automated algorithms or when scalp 
      electrodes are not present.

AB  - Here we present a collection of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from 
      24 observers (14 females, 10 males, mean age: 25.4) while observing 
      individually-presented stimuli comprised of 96 real-world objects, and 96 images 
      of the same items printed in high-resolution. EEG was recorded from 128 scalp 
      channels. Six additional external electrodes were used to record vertical and 
      horizontal electrooculogram, as well as the signal from the left and right 
      mastoid. EEG has been pre-processed, segmented in non-overlapping epochs, and 
      independent component analysis (ICA) has been conducted to reject artifacts. 
      Moreover, supplemental pre-processing steps have been completed to facilitate the 
      analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). These data are linked to the article 
      "Distinct visuo-motor brain dynamics for real-world objects versus planar 
      images". Alongside this data we provide the custom-written Matlab(®) code that 
      can be used to fully reproduce all analyses and figures presented in the linked 
      research article.

TI  - Adaptive and Wireless Recordings of Electrophysiological Signals During 
      Concurrent Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
PG  - 1649-1657
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2018.2877640 [doi]
AB  - Strong electromagnetic fields that occur during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) presents a challenging environment for concurrent 
      electrophysiological recordings. Here, we present a miniaturized, wireless 
      platform-"MR-Link" (Multimodal Recording Link) that provides a hardware solution 
      for simultaneous electrophysiological and fMRI signal acquisition. The device 
      detects the changes in the electromagnetic field during fMRI to synchronize 
      amplification and sampling of electrophysiological signals with minimal 
      artifacts. It wirelessly transmits the recorded data at a frequency detectable by 
      the MR-receiver coil. The transmitted data is readily separable from MRI in the 
      frequency domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we used this device to record 
      electrocardiograms and somatosensory evoked potential during concurrent fMRI 
      scans. The device minimized the fMRI-induced artifacts in electrophysiological 
      data and wirelessly transmitted the data back to the receiver coil without 
      compromising the fMRI signal quality. The device is compact (22 mm dia., 2 gms) 
      and can be placed within the MRI bore to precisely synchronize with fMRI. 
      Therefore, MR-Link offers an inexpensive system by eliminating the need for 
      amplifiers with a high dynamic range, high-speed sampling, additional storage, or 
      synchronization hardware for electrophysiological signal acquisition. It is 
      expected to enable a broader range of applications of simultaneous fMRI and 
      electrophysiology in animals and humans.

AB  - The steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) collected from the scalp 
      suffers from strong noise and is contaminated by artifacts such as the 
      electrooculogram (EOG) and the electromyogram (EMG). Spatial filtering methods 
      can fuse the information of different brain regions, which is beneficial for the 
      enhancement of the active components of the SSMVEP. Traditional spatial filtering 
      methods fuse electroencephalogram (EEG) in the time domain. Based on the idea of 
      image fusion, this study proposed an SSMVEP enhancement method based on 
      time-frequency (T-F) image fusion. The purpose is to fuse SSMVEP in the T-F 
      domain and improve the enhancement effect of the traditional spatial filtering 
      method on SSMVEP active components. Firstly, two electrode signals were 
      transformed from the time domain to the T-F domain via short-time Fourier 
      transform (STFT). The transformed T-F signals can be regarded as T-F images. 
      Then, two T-F images were decomposed via two-dimensional multiscale wavelet 
      decomposition, and both the high-frequency coefficients and low-frequency 
      coefficients of the wavelet were fused by specific fusion rules. The two images 
      were fused into one image via two-dimensional wavelet reconstruction. The fused 
      image was subjected to mean filtering, and finally, the fused time-domain signal 
      was obtained by inverse STFT (ISTFT). The experimental results show that the 
      proposed method has better enhancement effect on SSMVEP active components than 
      the traditional spatial filtering methods. This study indicates that it is 
      feasible to fuse SSMVEP in the T-F domain, which provides a new idea for SSMVEP 
      analysis.

TI  - An Unsupervised Method for Artefact Removal in EEG Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s19102302 [doi]
LID - 2302
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The activity of the brain can be recorded by means of an 
      electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG is a multichannel signal related to brain 
      activity. However, EEG presents a wide variety of undesired artefacts. Removal of 
      these artefacts is often done using blind source separation methods (BSS) and 
      mainly those based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA-based methods are 
      well-accepted in the literature for filtering artefacts and have proved to be 
      satisfactory in most scenarios of interest. Our goal is to develop a generic and 
      unsupervised ICA-based algorithm for EEG artefacts removal. APPROACH: The 
      proposed algorithm makes use of a new unsupervised artefact detection, ICA and a 
      statistical criterion to automatically select the artefact related independent 
      components (ICs) requiring no human intervention. The algorithm is evaluated 
      using both simulated and real EEG data with artefacts (SEEG and AEEG). A 
      comparison between the proposed unsupervised selection of ICs related to the 
      artefact and other supervised selection is also presented. MAIN RESULTS: A new 
      unsupervised ICA-based algorithm to filter artefacts, where ICs related to each 
      artefact are automatically selected. It can be used in online applications, it 
      preserves most of the original information among the artefacts and removes 
      different types of artefacts. SIGNIFICANCE: ICA-based methods for filtering 
      artefacts prevail in the literature. The work in this article is important 
      insofar as it addresses the problem of automatic selection of ICs in ICA-based 
      methods. The selection is unsupervised, avoiding the manual ICs selection or a 
      learning process involved in other methods. Our method is a generic algorithm 
      that allows removing EEG artefacts of various types and, unlike some ICA-based 
      algorithms, it retains most of the original information among the artefacts. 
      Within the algorithm, the artefact detection method implemented does not require 
      human intervention either.

TI  - Automatic Removal of Cardiac Interference (ARCI): A New Approach for EEG Data.
PG  - 441
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2019.00441 [doi]
LID - 441
AB  - EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and 
      non-physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder 
      effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the 
      electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood 
      flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for 
      artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety 
      of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that 
      could restrict movement. We developed an automatic method for classifying and 
      removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does 
      not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component 
      analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the 
      artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency 
      domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during 
      an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with 
      either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 
      64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components 
      to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact 
      detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs 
      classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. 
      Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an 
      overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and 
      an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data 
      were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved 
      perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic 
      component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs 
      automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG 
      activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference 
      affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact 
      removal. Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal 
      of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition 
      settings making it ideal for sports science applications.

AB  - Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) is an adaptive method for the online or 
      offline correction of artifacts comprising multichannel electroencephalography 
      (EEG) recordings. It repeatedly computes a principal component analysis (PCA) on 
      covariance matrices to detect artifacts based on their statistical properties in 
      the component subspace. We adapted the existing ASR implementation by using 
      Riemannian geometry for covariance matrix processing. EEG data that were recorded 
      on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N 
      = 27). A direct comparison between the original ASR and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was 
      conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), 
      improvement of visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) (specificity), and computation 
      time (efficiency). Compared to ASR, our rASR algorithm performed favorably on all 
      three measures. We conclude that rASR is suitable for the offline and online 
      correction of multichannel EEG data acquired in laboratory and in field 
      conditions.

TI  - Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from alpha-Band Activity in 
      the Human Brain.
LID - ENEURO.0483-18.2019 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0483-18.2019 [doi]
AB  - Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality 
      well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, 
      but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. 
      We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant 
      rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a 
      drop in amplitude of electroencephalography (EEG) alpha-oscillations (8-13 Hz) 
      occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha-event-related desynchronization 
      (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and 
      cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and 
      somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered 
      only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed 
      downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited 
      by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed 
      upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local 
      human population, rather than a generic physical effect. Biophysical tests showed 
      that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic 
      field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from 
      the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. 
      The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. 
      This rules out free-radical "quantum compass" mechanisms like the cryptochrome 
      hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a 
      viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to 
      start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.

TI  - fNIRS Evidence for Recognizably Different Positive Emotions.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2019.00120 [doi]
LID - 120
AB  - The behavioral differentiation of positive emotions has recently been studied in 
      terms of their discrete adaptive functions or appraising profiles. Some 
      preliminary neurophysiological evidences have been found with 
      electroencephalography or autonomic nervous system measurements such as heart 
      rate, skin conductance, etc. However, the brain's hemodynamic responses to 
      different positive emotions remain largely unknown. In the present study, the 
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique was employed. With this 
      tool, we for the first time reported recognizable discrete positive emotions 
      using fNIRS signals. Thirteen participants watched 30 emotional video clips to 
      elicit 10 typical kinds of positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, 
      hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love), and their frontal neural 
      activities were simultaneously recorded with a 24-channel fNIRS system. The 
      multidimensional scaling analysis of participants' subjective ratings on these 10 
      positive emotions revealed three distinct clusters, which could be interpreted as 
      "playfulness" for amusement, joy, interest, "encouragement" for awe, gratitude, 
      hope, inspiration, pride, and "harmony" for love, serenity. Hemodynamic responses 
      to these three positive emotion clusters showed distinct patterns, and HbO-based 
      individual-level binary classifications between them achieved an averaged 
      accuracy of 73.79 ± 11.49% (77.56 ± 7.39% for encouragement vs. harmony, 73.29 ± 
      11.87% for playfulness vs. harmony, 70.51 ± 13.96% for encouragement vs. 
      harmony). Benefited from fNIRS's high portability, low running cost and the 
      relative robustness against motion and electrical artifacts, our findings 
      provided support for implementing a more fine-grained emotion recognition system 
      with subdivided positive emotion categories.

TI  - An EEG-Based Identity Authentication System with Audiovisual Paradigm in IoT.
LID - 10.3390/s19071664 [doi]
LID - 1664
AB  - With the continuous increment of security risks and the limitations of 
      traditional modes, it is necessary to design a universal and trustworthy identity 
      authentication system for intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications such 
      as an intelligent entrance guard. The characteristics of EEG 
      (electroencephalography) have gained the confidence of researchers due to its 
      uniqueness, stability, and universality. However, the limited usability of the 
      experimental paradigm and the unsatisfactory classification accuracy have so far 
      prevented the identity authentication system based on EEG to become commonplace 
      in IoT scenarios. To address these problems, an audiovisual presentation paradigm 
      is proposed to record the EEG signals of subjects. In the pre-processing stage, 
      the reference electrode, ensemble averaging, and independent component analysis 
      methods are used to remove artifacts. In the feature extraction stage, adaptive 
      feature selection and bagging ensemble learning algorithms establish the optimal 
      classification model. The experimental result shows that our proposal achieves 
      the best classification accuracy when compared with other paradigms and typical 
      EEG-based authentication methods, and the test evaluation on a login scenario is 
      designed to further demonstrate that the proposed system is feasible, effective, 
      and reliable.

TI  - Simultaneous EIT and EEG using frequency division multiplexing.
PG  - 034007
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab0bbc [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methods have previously been reported for simultaneous EIT and EEG 
      recording, but these have relied on post-hoc signal processing to remove 
      switching artefacts from the EEG signal and require dedicated hardware filters 
      and the use of separate EEG and EIT electrodes. This work aims to demonstrate 
      that an uncorrupted EEG signal can be collected simultaneously with EIT data by 
      using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and to show that the EIT data 
      provides useful information when compared to EEG source localisation. APPROACH: A 
      custom FDM EIT current source was created and evaluated in resistor phantom and 
      neonatal head tank experiments, where a static and dynamic perturbation was 
      imaged. EEG and EIT source localisation were compared when an EEG dipole was 
      placed in the tank. EEG and EIT data were collected simultaneously in a human 
      volunteer, using both a standard EEG and a visual evoked potential (VEP) 
      paradigms. MAIN RESULTS: Differences in EEG and VEP collected with and without 
      simultaneous EIT stimulation showed no significant differences in amplitude, 
      latency or PSD (p-values  >0.3 in all cases). Compared with EEG source 
      localisation, EIT reconstructions were more accurately able to reconstruct both 
      the centre of mass and volume of a perturbation. SIGNIFICANCE: The reported 
      method is suitable for collecting EIT in a clinical setting, without disrupting 
      the clinical EEG or requiring additional measurement electrodes, which lowers the 
      barrier to entry for data collection. EIT collection can be integrated with 
      existing clinical workflows in EEG/ECoG, with minimal disruption to the patient 
      or clinical team.

TI  - Expandable Lattice Electrode Ablation Catheter: A Novel Radiofrequency Platform 
      Allowing High Current at Low Density for Rapid, Titratable, and Durable Lesions.
PG  - e007090
LID - 10.1161/CIRCEP.118.007090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-current short-duration radiofrequency energy delivery has 
      potential advantages for cardiac ablation. However, this strategy is limited by 
      high current density and narrow safety-to-efficacy window. The objective of this 
      study was to examine a novel strategy for radiofrequency energy delivery using a 
      new electrode design capable of delivering high power at a low current density to 
      increase the therapeutic range of radiofrequency ablation. METHODS: The Sphere9 
      is an expandable spheroid-shaped lattice electrode design with an effective 
      surface area 10-fold larger than standard irrigated electrodes (lattice 
      catheter). It incorporates 9 surface temperature sensors with ablation performed 
      in a temperature-controlled mode. Phase I: in 6 thigh muscle preparations, 2 
      energy settings for atrial ablation were compared between the lattice and 
      irrigated-tip catheters (low-energy: T(max)75°C/5 s versus 25 W/20 s; 
      high-energy: T(max)75°C/7 s versus 30 W/20 s). Phase II: in 8 swine, right atrial 
      lines were created in the posterior and lateral walls using low- and high-energy 
      settings, respectively. Phase III: the safety, efficacy, and durability at 30 
      days were evaluated by electroanatomical mapping and histopathologic analysis. 
      RESULTS: In the thigh model, the lattice catheter resulted in wider lesions at 
      both low- and high-energy settings (18.7±3.3 versus 12.2±1.7 mm, P<0.0001; 
      19.4±2.4 versus 12.3±1.7 mm, P<0.0001). Atrial lines created with the lattice 
      were wider (posterior: 14.7±3.4 versus 9.2±4.0 mm, P<0.0001; lateral: 15.8±4.2 
      versus 5.7±4.2 mm, P<0.0001) and required 85% shorter ablation time (12.4 versus 
      79.8 s/cm-line). While current squared (I(2)) was higher with Sphere9 (7.0±0.04 
      versus 0.2±0.002 A(2); P<0.0001), the current density was lower (9.6±0.9 versus 
      16.9±0.09 mA/mm(2); P<0.0001). At 30 days, 100% of ablation lines created with 
      the lattice catheter remained contiguous compared with only 14.3% lines created 
      with a standard irrigated catheter. This was achieved without steam pops or 
      collateral tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: In this preclinical model, a novel, 
      high-current low-density radiofrequency ablation strategy created contiguous and 
      durable ablation lines in significantly less ablation time and a comparable 
      safety profile.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tactile stimulations systems are useful for studying the 
      somatosensory system in children because they are innocuous and safe. Stimulators 
      based on piezoelectric actuator are useful, but there is still a need for such 
      systems capable of providing accurate and versatile control of timing and pattern 
      of activation. NEW METHOD: We have implemented a vibrotactile stimulating system 
      useful for behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography 
      (MEG) research. Our design goal was to create a system capable of providing up to 
      five independently controlled mechanical stimulations with precise timing. We 
      developed a Graphic User Interface (GUI) in LabVIEW, which controls a 
      commercially available piezoelectric braille stimulator using an Arduino based 
      controller. We made a customized braille stimulator based on the Metec Braille 
      device. RESULTS: Our system can control up to five tactile stimulators with 
      independent timing control and negligible errors. Although it can be directly 
      used for behavioral and EEG research, the piezoelectric stimulators in our system 
      generate stimulus artifacts that interfere with MEG recordings. A moving 
      averaging subtraction algorithm we developed can remove the artifact. The 
      stimulator can be used to measure somatic evoked magnetic fields from the 
      somatosensory cortex of a child without the artifact. COMPARISON TO EXISTING 
      METHODS: Our system provides an accurate independent control of one or more 
      piezoelectric actuators using a GUI-based easy-to-control programming approach 
      based on recent advances in embedded systems and software. Versatility and 
      precise stimulation timing distinguish our system compared to existing somatic 
      stimulators. CONCLUSIONS: Our system may be useful for somatic research.

AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals can often 
      be exposed to strong power line interference at 50 or 60 Hz. A widely used method 
      to remove line noise is the notch filter, but it comes with the risk of 
      potentially severe signal distortions. Among other approaches, the Discrete 
      Fourier Transform (DFT) filter and CleanLine have been developed as alternatives, 
      but they may fail to remove power line noise of highly fluctuating amplitude. 
      Here we introduce spectrum interpolation as a new method to remove line noise in 
      the EEG and MEG signal. This approach had been developed for electromyographic 
      (EMG) signals, and combines the advantages of a notch filter, while synthetic 
      test signals indicate that it introduces less distortion in the time domain. The 
      effectiveness of this method is compared to CleanLine, the notch (Butterworth) 
      and DFT filter. In order to quantify the performance of these three methods, we 
      used synthetic test signals and simulated power line noise with fluctuating 
      amplitude and abrupt on- and offsets that were added to an MEG dataset free of 
      line noise. In addition, all methods were applied to EEG data with massive power 
      line noise due to acquisition in unshielded settings. We show that spectrum 
      interpolation outperforms the DFT filter and CleanLine, when power line noise is 
      nonstationary. At the same time, spectrum interpolation performs equally well as 
      the notch filter in removing line noise artifacts, but shows less distortions in 
      the time domain in many common situations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Due to its high temporal resolution, electroencephalography (EEG) has 
      become a promising tool for quantifying cortical dynamics and effective 
      connectivity in a mobile setting. While many connectivity estimators are 
      available, the efficacy of these measures has not been rigorously validated in 
      real-world scenarios. The goal of this study was to quantify the accuracy of 
      independent component analysis and multiple connectivity measures on ground-truth 
      connections while exposed real-world volume conduction and head motion. APPROACH: 
      We collected high-density EEG from a phantom head with embedded antennae, using 
      neural mass models to generate transiently interconnected signals. The head was 
      mounted upon a motion platform that mimicked recorded human head motion at 
      various walking speeds. We used cross-correlation and signal to noise ratio to 
      determine how well independent component analysis recovered the original antenna 
      signals. For connectivity measures, we computed the average and standard 
      deviation across frequency of each estimated connectivity peak. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Independent component analysis recovered most antenna signals, as evidenced by 
      cross-correlations primarily above 0.8, and maintained consistent signal to noise 
      ratio values near 10 dB across walking speeds compared to scalp channel data, 
      which had decreased signal to noise ratios of ~2 dB at fast walking speeds. The 
      connectivity measures used were generally able to identify the true 
      interconnections, but some measures were susceptible to spurious high-frequency 
      connections inducing large standard deviations of ~10 Hz. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      results indicate that independent component analysis and some connectivity 
      measures can be effective at recovering underlying connections among brain areas. 
      These results highlight the utility of validating EEG processing techniques with 
      a combination of complex signals, phantom head use, and realistic head motion.

PG  - 225-234
LID - 10.1007/s12021-018-9397-6 [doi]
AB  - Manual and semi-automatic identification of artifacts and unwanted physiological 
      signals in large intracerebral electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings is time 
      consuming and inaccurate. To date, unsupervised methods to accurately detect iEEG 
      artifacts are not available. This study introduces a novel machine-learning 
      approach for detection of artifacts in iEEG signals in clinically controlled 
      conditions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and benchmarks the method's 
      performance against expert annotations. The method was trained and tested on data 
      obtained from St Anne's University Hospital (Brno, Czech Republic) and validated 
      on data from Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, U.S.A). We show that the proposed 
      technique can be used as a generalized model for iEEG artifact detection. 
      Moreover, a transfer learning process might be used for retraining of the 
      generalized version to form a data-specific model. The generalized model can be 
      efficiently retrained for use with different EEG acquisition systems and noise 
      environments. The generalized and specialized model F1 scores on the testing 
      dataset were 0.81 and 0.96, respectively. The CNN model provides faster, more 
      objective, and more reproducible iEEG artifact detection compared to manual 
      approaches.

TI  - Automatic artefact detection in single-channel sleep EEG recordings.
PG  - e12679
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12679 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative electroencephalogram analysis (e.g. spectral analysis) has become an 
      important tool in sleep research and sleep medicine. However, reliable results 
      are only obtained if artefacts are removed or excluded. Artefact detection is 
      often performed manually during sleep stage scoring, which is time consuming and 
      prevents application to large datasets. We aimed to test the performance of 
      mostly simple algorithms of artefact detection in polysomnographic recordings, 
      derive optimal parameters and test their generalization capacity. We implemented 
      14 different artefact detection methods, optimized parameters for derivation C3A2 
      using receiver operator characteristic curves of 32 recordings, and validated 
      them on 21 recordings of healthy participants and 10 recordings of patients 
      (different laboratory) and considered the methods as generalizable. We also 
      compared average power density spectra with artefacts excluded based on 
      algorithms and expert scoring. Analyses were performed retrospectively. We could 
      reliably identify artefact contaminated epochs in sleep electroencephalogram 
      recordings of two laboratories (healthy participants and patients) reaching good 
      sensitivity (specificity 0.9) with most algorithms. The best performance was 
      obtained using fixed thresholds of the electroencephalogram slope, high-frequency 
      power (25-90 Hz or 45-90 Hz) and residuals of adaptive autoregressive models. 
      Artefacts in electroencephalogram data can be reliably excluded by simple 
      algorithms with good performance, and average electroencephalogram power density 
      spectra with artefact exclusion based on algorithms and manual scoring are very 
      similar in the frequency range relevant for most applications in sleep research 
      and sleep medicine, allowing application to large datasets as needed to address 
      questions related to genetics, epidemiology or precision medicine.

AB  - To better understand human brain dynamics during visually guided locomotion, we 
      developed a method of removing motion artifacts from mobile 
      electroencephalography (EEG) and studied human subjects walking and running over 
      obstacles on a treadmill. We constructed a novel dual-layer EEG electrode system 
      to isolate electrocortical signals, and then validated the system using an 
      electrical head phantom and robotic motion platform. We collected data from young 
      healthy subjects walking and running on a treadmill while they encountered 
      unexpected obstacles to step over. Supplementary motor area and premotor cortex 
      had spectral power increases within ~200 ms after object appearance in delta, 
      theta, and alpha frequency bands (3-13 Hz). That activity was followed by similar 
      posterior parietal cortex spectral power increase that decreased in lag time with 
      increasing locomotion speed. The sequence of activation suggests that 
      supplementary motor area and premotor cortex interrupted the gait cycle, while 
      posterior parietal cortex tracked obstacle location for planning foot placement 
      nearly two steps ahead of reaching the obstacle. Together, these results 
      highlight advantages of adopting dual-layer mobile EEG, which should greatly 
      facilitate the study of human brain dynamics in physically active real-world 
      settings and tasks.

AB  - Brain monitoring combined with automatic analysis of EEGs provides a clinical 
      decision support tool that can reduce time to diagnosis and assist clinicians in 
      real-time monitoring applications (e.g., neurological intensive care units). 
      Clinicians have indicated that a sensitivity of 95% with specificity below 5% was 
      the minimum requirement for clinical acceptance. In this study, a 
      high-performance automated EEG analysis system based on principles of machine 
      learning and big data is proposed. This hybrid architecture integrates hidden 
      Markov models (HMMs) for sequential decoding of EEG events with deep 
      learning-based post-processing that incorporates temporal and spatial context. 
      These algorithms are trained and evaluated using the Temple University Hospital 
      EEG, which is the largest publicly available corpus of clinical EEG recordings in 
      the world. This system automatically processes EEG records and classifies three 
      patterns of clinical interest in brain activity that might be useful in 
      diagnosing brain disorders: (1) spike and/or sharp waves, (2) generalized 
      periodic epileptiform discharges, (3) periodic lateralized epileptiform 
      discharges. It also classifies three patterns used to model the background EEG 
      activity: (1) eye movement, (2) artifacts, and (3) background. Our approach 
      delivers a sensitivity above 90% while maintaining a specificity below 5%. We 
      also demonstrate that this system delivers a low false alarm rate, which is 
      critical for any spike detection application.

TI  - Perceptual reversals in binocular rivalry: Improved detection from OKN.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1167/19.3.5 [doi]
AB  - When binocular rivalry is induced by opponent motion displays, perceptual 
      reversals are often associated with changed oculomotor behavior (Frässle, Sommer, 
      Jansen, Naber, & Einhäuser, 2014; Fujiwara et al., 2017). Specifically, the 
      direction of smooth pursuit phases in optokinetic nystagmus typically corresponds 
      to the direction of motion that dominates perceptual appearance at any given 
      time. Here we report an improved analysis that continuously estimates perceived 
      motion in terms of "cumulative smooth pursuit." In essence, smooth pursuit 
      segments are identified, interpolated where necessary, and joined 
      probabilistically into a continuous record of cumulative smooth pursuit (i.e., 
      probability of eye position disregarding blinks, saccades, signal losses, and 
      artefacts). The analysis is fully automated and robust in healthy, developmental, 
      and patient populations. To validate reliability, we compare volitional reports 
      of perceptual reversals in rivalry displays, and of physical reversals in 
      nonrivalrous control displays. Cumulative smooth pursuit detects physical 
      reversals and estimates eye velocity more accurately than existing methods do 
      (Frässle et al., 2014). It also appears to distinguish dominant and transitional 
      perceptual states, detecting changes with a precision of ±100 ms. We conclude 
      that cumulative smooth pursuit significantly improves the monitoring of binocular 
      rivalry by means of recording optokinetic nystagmus.

TI  - Cortical Signal Suppression (CSS) for Detection of Subcortical Activity Using MEG 
      and EEG.
PG  - 215-228
LID - 10.1007/s10548-018-00694-5 [doi]
AB  - Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) use non-invasive 
      sensors to detect neural currents. Since the contribution of superficial neural 
      sources to the measured M/EEG signals are orders-of-magnitude stronger than the 
      contribution of subcortical sources, most MEG and EEG studies have focused on 
      cortical activity. Subcortical structures, however, are centrally involved in 
      both healthy brain function as well as in many neurological disorders such as 
      Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we present a method 
      that can separate and suppress the cortical signals while preserving the 
      subcortical contributions to the M/EEG data. The resulting signal subspace of the 
      data mainly originates from subcortical structures. Our method works by utilizing 
      short-baseline planar gradiometers with short-sighted sensitivity distributions 
      as reference sensors for cortical activity. Since the method is completely 
      data-driven, forward and inverse modeling are not required. In this study, we use 
      simulations and auditory steady state response experiments in a human subject to 
      demonstrate that the method can remove the cortical signals while sparing the 
      subcortical signals. We also test our method on MEG data recorded in an essential 
      tremor patient with a deep brain stimulation implant and show how it can be used 
      to reduce the DBS artifact in the MEG data by ~ 99.9% without affecting low 
      frequency brain rhythms.

TI  - Removal of Artifacts from EEG Signals: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/s19050987 [doi]
LID - 987
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an important role in identifying brain activity 
      and behavior. However, the recorded electrical activity always be contaminated 
      with artifacts and then affect the analysis of EEG signal. Hence, it is essential 
      to develop methods to effectively detect and extract the clean EEG data during 
      encephalogram recordings. Several methods have been proposed to remove artifacts, 
      but the research on artifact removal continues to be an open problem. This paper 
      tends to review the current artifact removal of various contaminations. We first 
      discuss the characteristics of EEG data and the types of different artifacts. 
      Then, a general overview of the state-of-the-art methods and their detail 
      analysis are presented. Lastly, a comparative analysis is provided for choosing a 
      suitable methods according to particular application.

AB  - Seizures in the newborn are associated with high morbidity and mortality, making 
      their detection and treatment critical. Seizure activity in neonates is often 
      clinically obscured, such that detection of seizures is particularly challenging. 
      Amplitude-integrated EEG is a technique for simplified EEG monitoring that has 
      found an increasing clinical application in neonatal intensive care. Its main 
      value lies in the relative simplicity of interpretation, allowing nonspecialist 
      members of the care team to engage in real-time detection of electrographic 
      seizures. Nevertheless, to avoiding misdiagnosing rhythmic artifacts as seizures, 
      it is necessary to recognize the electrophysiological ictal pattern in the 
      conventional EEG trace available in current devices. The aim of this paper is to 
      discuss the electrophysiological basis of the differentiation of epileptic 
      seizures and extracranial artifacts to avoid misdiagnosis with 
      amplitude-integrated EEG devices.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of stereotactic laser ablation for epileptogenic 
      cerebral cavernous malformations.
PG  - 220-232

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance (MR) thermography-guided laser interstitial thermal 
      therapy, or stereotactic laser ablation (SLA), is a minimally invasive 
      alternative to open surgery for focal epilepsy caused by cerebral cavernous 
      malformations (CCMs). We examined the safety and effectiveness of SLA of 
      epileptogenic CCMs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 19 consecutive patients 
      who presented with focal seizures associated with a CCM. Each patient underwent 
      SLA of the CCM and adjacent cortex followed by standard clinical and imaging 
      follow-up. RESULTS: All but one patient had chronic medically refractory epilepsy 
      (median duration 8 years, range 0.5-52 years). Lesions were located in the 
      temporal (13), frontal (five), and parietal (one) lobes. CCMs induced magnetic 
      susceptibility artifacts during thermometry, but perilesional cortex was easily 
      visualized. Fourteen of 17 patients (82%) with >12 months of follow-up achieved 
      Engel class I outcomes, of which 10 (59%) were Engel class IA. Two patients who 
      were not seizure-free from SLA alone became so following intracranial 
      electrode-guided open resection. Delayed postsurgical imaging validated CCM 
      involution (median 83% volume reduction) and ablation of surrounding cortex. 
      Histopathologic examination of one previously ablated CCM following open surgery 
      confirmed obliteration. SLA caused no detectable hemorrhages. Two symptomatic 
      neurologic deficits (visual and motor) were predictable, and neither was 
      permanently disabling. SIGNIFICANCE: In a consecutive retrospective series, MR 
      thermography-guided SLA was an effective alternative to open surgery for 
      epileptogenic CCM. The approach was free of hemorrhagic complications, and 
      clinically significant neurologic deficits were predictable. SLA presents no 
      barrier to subsequent open surgery when needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) patterns are common after 
      resuscitation from cardiac arrest and have clinical and prognostic importance. 
      Bedside continuous EEGs are not available in many institutions. We tested the 
      feasibility of using a point-of-care system for EEG acquisition. METHODS: We 
      prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of post-cardiac arrest patients 
      between 9/2015-1/2017. Upon hospital arrival, a limited EEG montage was applied. 
      We tested both continuous EEG (cEEG) and this point-of-care EEG (eEEG). A 
      board-certified epileptologist and a board-certified neurointensivist jointly 
      reviewed all EEGs. Cohen's kappa coefficient evaluated agreement between eEEG and 
      cEEG and Fisher's exact test evaluated their associations with survival to 
      hospital discharge and proximate cause of death. RESULTS: We studied 95 comatose 
      post-cardiac arrest patients. Mean age was 59 (SD17) years. Most (61%) were male, 
      few (N = 22; 23%) demonstrated shockable rhythms, and PCAC IV illness severity 
      was present in 58 (61%). eEEG was interpretable in 57 (60%) subjects. The most 
      common eEEG interpretations were: continuous (21%), generalized suppression 
      (14%), burst-suppression (12%) and burst-suppression with identical bursts (10%). 
      Seizures were detected in 2 eEEG subjects (2%). No patient with seizure or 
      burst-suppression with identical bursts survived. cEEG demonstrated generalized 
      suppression (31%), burst-suppression with identical bursts (27%), continuous 
      (18%) and seizure (4%). The eEEG and cEEG demonstrated fair agreement 
      (kappa = 0.27). Neither eEEG nor cEEG was associated with survival (p = 0.19; 
      p = 0.11) or proximate cause of death (p = 0.14; p = 0.8) CONCLUSIONS: eEEG is 
      feasible, although artifact often precludes interpretation. eEEG is fairly 
      associated with cEEG and may facilitate post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Exploring the relative efficacy of motion artefact correction techniques for EEG 
      data acquired during simultaneous fMRI.
PG  - 578-596
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24396 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous EEG-fMRI allows multiparametric characterisation of brain function, 
      in principle enabling a more complete understanding of brain responses; 
      unfortunately the hostile MRI environment severely reduces EEG data quality. 
      Simply eliminating data segments containing gross motion artefacts [MAs] 
      (generated by movement of the EEG system and head in the MRI scanner's static 
      magnetic field) was previously believed sufficient. However recently the 
      importance of removal of all MAs has been highlighted and new methods developed. 
      A systematic comparison of the ability to remove MAs and retain underlying 
      neuronal activity using different methods of MA detection and post-processing 
      algorithms is needed to guide the neuroscience community. Using a head phantom, 
      we recorded MAs while simultaneously monitoring the motion using three different 
      approaches: Reference Layer Artefact Subtraction (RLAS), Moiré Phase Tracker 
      (MPT) markers and Wire Loop Motion Sensors (WLMS). These EEG recordings were 
      combined with EEG responses to simple visual tasks acquired on a subject outside 
      the MRI environment. MAs were then corrected using the motion information 
      collected with each of the methods combined with different analysis pipelines. 
      All tested methods retained the neuronal signal. However, often the MA was not 
      removed sufficiently to allow accurate detection of the underlying neuronal 
      signal. We show that the MA is best corrected using the RLAS combined with 
      post-processing using a multichannel, recursive least squares (M-RLS) algorithm. 
      This method needs to be developed further to enable practical utility; thus, WLMS 
      combined with M-RLS currently provides the best compromise between EEG data 
      quality and practicalities of motion detection.

TI  - Quality Assessment of Single-Channel EEG for Wearable Devices.
LID - 10.3390/s19030601 [doi]
LID - 601
AB  - The recent embedding of electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes in wearable 
      devices raises the problem of the quality of the data recorded in such 
      uncontrolled environments. These recordings are often obtained with dry 
      single-channel EEG devices, and may be contaminated by many sources of noise 
      which can compromise the detection and characterization of the brain state 
      studied. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to effectively 
      quantify artefact contamination in EEG segments, and discriminate muscular 
      artefacts. The performance of our method were assessed on different databases 
      containing either artificially contaminated or real artefacts recorded with 
      different type of sensors, including wet and dry EEG electrodes. Furthermore, the 
      quality of unlabelled databases was evaluated. For all the studied databases, the 
      proposed method is able to rapidly assess the quality of the EEG signals with an 
      accuracy higher than 90%. The obtained performance suggests that our approach 
      provide an efficient, fast and automated quality assessment of EEG signals from 
      low-cost wearable devices typically composed of a dry single EEG channel.

TI  - An Unsupervised Multichannel Artifact Detection Method for Sleep EEG Based on 
      Riemannian Geometry.

AB  - In biomedical signal processing, we often face the problem of artifacts that 
      distort the original signals. This concerns also sleep recordings, such as EEG. 
      Artifacts may severely affect or even make impossible visual inspection, as well 
      as automatic processing. Many proposed methods concentrate on certain artifact 
      types. Therefore, artifact-free data are often obtained after sequential 
      application of different methods. Moreover, single-channel approaches must be 
      applied to all channels alternately. The aim of this study is to develop a 
      multichannel artifact detection method for multichannel sleep EEG capable of 
      rejecting different artifact types at once. The inspiration for the study is 
      gained from recent advances in the field of Riemannian geometry. The method we 
      propose is tested on real datasets. The performance of the proposed method is 
      measured by comparing detection results with the expert labeling as a reference 
      and evaluated against a simpler method based on Riemannian geometry that has 
      previously been proposed, as well as against the state-of-the-art method FASTER. 
      The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Estimation of auditory steady-state responses based on the averaging of 
      independent EEG epochs.

AB  - The amplitude of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) generated in the 
      brainstem of rats exponentially decreases over the sequential averaging of EEG 
      epochs. This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the ASSR induced by 
      the continuous and monotonous stimulation. In this study, we analyzed the 
      potential clinical relevance of the ASSR adaptation. ASSR were elicited in eight 
      anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. We 
      called independent epochs to those EEG epochs acquired with sufficiently long 
      inter-stimulus interval, so the ASSR contained in any given epoch is not affected 
      by the previous stimulation. We tested whether the detection of ASSRs is improved 
      when the response is computed by averaging independent EEG epochs, containing 
      only unadapted auditory responses. The improvements in the ASSR detection 
      obtained with standard, weighted and sorted averaging were compared. In the 
      absence of artifacts, when the ASSR was elicited by continuous acoustic 
      stimulation, the computation of the ASSR amplitude relied upon the averaging 
      method. While the adaptive behavior of the ASSR was still evident after the 
      weighting of epochs, the sorted averaging resulted in under-estimations of the 
      ASSR amplitude. In the absence of artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes computed by 
      averaging independent epochs did not depend on the averaging procedure. Averaging 
      independent epochs resulted in higher ASSR amplitudes and halved the number of 
      EEG epochs needed to be acquired to achieve the maximum detection rate of the 
      ASSR. Acquisition protocols based on averaging independent EEG epochs, in 
      combination with appropriate averaging methods for artifact reduction might 
      contribute to develop more accurate hearing assessments based on ASSRs.

TI  - Postconvulsive central apnea as a biomarker for sudden unexpected death in 
      epilepsy (SUDEP).
PG  - e171-e182
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006785 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize peri-ictal apnea and postictal asystole in generalized 
      convulsive seizures (GCS) of intractable epilepsy. METHODS: This was a 
      prospective, multicenter epilepsy monitoring study of autonomic and breathing 
      biomarkers of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients ≥18 years 
      old with intractable epilepsy and monitored GCS. Video-EEG, thoracoabdominal 
      excursions, nasal airflow, capillary oxygen saturation, and ECG were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We studied 148 GCS in 87 patients. Nineteen patients had generalized 
      epilepsy; 65 had focal epilepsy; 1 had both; and the epileptogenic zone was 
      unknown in 2. Ictal central apnea (ICA) preceded GCS in 49 of 121 (40.4%) 
      seizures in 23 patients, all with focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea 
      (PCCA) occurred in 31 of 140 (22.1%) seizures in 22 patients, with generalized, 
      focal, or unknown epileptogenic zones. In 2 patients, PCCA occurred concurrently 
      with asystole (near-SUDEP), with an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1,000 
      patient-years. One patient with PCCA died of probable SUDEP during follow-up, 
      suggesting a SUDEP incidence rate 5.1 per 1,000 patient-years. No cases of 
      laryngospasm were detected. Rhythmic muscle artifact synchronous with breathing 
      was present in 75 of 147 seizures and related to stertorous breathing (odds ratio 
      3.856, 95% confidence interval 1.395-10.663, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: PCCA 
      occurred in both focal and generalized epilepsies, suggesting a different 
      pathophysiology from ICA, which occurred only in focal epilepsy. PCCA was seen in 
      2 near-SUDEP cases and 1 probable SUDEP case, suggesting that this phenomenon may 
      serve as a clinical biomarker of SUDEP. Larger studies are needed to validate 
      this observation. Rhythmic postictal muscle artifact is suggestive of post-GCS 
      breathing effort rather than a specific biomarker of laryngospasm.

AB  - Online imaging and neuromodulation is invalid if stimulation distorts 
      measurements beyond the point of accurate measurement. In theory, combining 
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with electroencephalography (EEG) 
      is compelling, as both use non-invasive electrodes and image-guided dose can be 
      informed by the reciprocity principle. To distinguish real changes in EEG from 
      stimulation artifacts, prior studies applied conventional signal processing 
      techniques (e.g. high-pass filtering, ICA). Here, we address the assumptions 
      underlying the suitability of these approaches. We distinguish physiological 
      artifacts - defined as artifacts resulting from interactions between the 
      stimulation induced voltage and the body and so inherent regardless of tDCS or 
      EEG hardware performance - from methodology-related artifacts - arising from 
      non-ideal experimental conditions or non-ideal stimulation and recording 
      equipment performance. Critically, we identify inherent physiological artifacts 
      which are present in all online EEG-tDCS: 1) cardiac distortion and 2) ocular 
      motor distortion. In conjunction, non-inherent physiological artifacts which can 
      be minimized in most experimental conditions include: 1) motion and 2) myogenic 
      distortion. Artifact dynamics were analyzed for varying stimulation parameters 
      (montage, polarity, current) and stimulation hardware. Together with concurrent 
      physiological monitoring (ECG, respiration, ocular, EMG, head motion), and 
      current flow modeling, each physiological artifact was explained by biological 
      source-specific body impedance changes, leading to incremental changes in scalp 
      DC voltage that are significantly larger than real neural signals. Because these 
      artifacts modulate the DC voltage and scale with applied current, they are dose 
      specific such that their contamination cannot be accounted for by conventional 
      experimental controls (e.g. differing stimulation montage or current as a 
      control). Moreover, because the EEG artifacts introduced by physiologic processes 
      during tDCS are high dimensional (as indicated by Generalized Singular Value 
      Decomposition- GSVD), non-stationary, and overlap highly with neurogenic 
      frequencies, these artifacts cannot be easily removed with conventional signal 
      processing techniques. Spatial filtering techniques (GSVD) suggest that the 
      removal of physiological artifacts would significantly degrade signal integrity. 
      Physiological artifacts, as defined here, would emerge only during tDCS, thus 
      processing techniques typically applied to EEG in the absence of tDCS would not 
      be suitable for artifact removal during tDCS. All concurrent EEG-tDCS must 
      account for physiological artifacts that are a) present regardless of equipment 
      used, and b) broadband and confound a broad range of experiments (e.g. 
      oscillatory activity and event related potentials). Removal of these artifacts 
      requires the recognition of their non-stationary, physiology-specific dynamics, 
      and individualized nature. We present a broad taxonomy of artifacts 
      (non/stimulation related), and suggest possible approaches and challenges to 
      denoising online EEG-tDCS stimulation artifacts.

AB  - Introduction: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) 
      ameliorates motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease and allows 
      reducing dopaminergic therapy. Beside effects on motor function STN-DBS 
      influences many non-motor symptoms, among which decline of verbal fluency test 
      performance is most consistently reported. The surgical procedure itself is the 
      likely cause of this decline, while the influence of the electrical stimulation 
      is still controversial. STN-DBS also produces widespread changes of cortical 
      activity as visualized by quantitative EEG. The present study aims to link an 
      alteration in verbal fluency performance by electrical stimulation of the STN to 
      alterations in quantitative EEG. Methods: Sixteen patients with STN-DBS were 
      included. All patients had a high density EEG recording (256 channels) while 
      testing verbal fluency in the stimulator on/off situation. The phonemic, 
      semantic, alternating phonemic and semantic fluency was tested (Regensburger 
      Wortflüssigkeits-Test). Results: On the group level, stimulation of STN did not 
      alter verbal fluency performance. EEG frequency analysis showed an increase of 
      relative alpha2 (10-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) power in the parieto-occipital 
      region (p ≤ 0.01). On the individual level, changes of verbal fluency induced by 
      stimulation of the STN were disparate and correlated inversely with delta power 
      in the left temporal lobe (p < 0.05). Conclusion: STN stimulation does not alter 
      verbal fluency performance in a systematic way at group level. However, when in 
      individual patients an alteration of verbal fluency performance is produced by 
      electrical stimulation of the STN, it correlates inversely with left temporal 
      delta power.

TI  - Removal of Gross Artifacts of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in 
      Simultaneous EEG Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s19010190 [doi]
LID - 190
AB  - Transcranial electrical stimulation is a widely used non-invasive brain 
      stimulation approach. To date, EEG has been used to evaluate the effect of 
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating 
      Current Stimulation (tACS), but most studies have been limited to exploring 
      changes in EEG before and after stimulation due to the presence of stimulation 
      artifacts in the EEG data. This paper presents two different algorithms for 
      removing the gross tACS artifact from simultaneous EEG recordings. These give 
      different trade-offs in removal performance, in the amount of data required, and 
      in their suitability for closed loop systems. Superposition of Moving Averages 
      and Adaptive Filtering techniques are investigated, with significant emphasis on 
      verification. We present head phantom testing results for controlled analysis, 
      together with on-person EEG recordings in the time domain, frequency domain, and 
      Event Related Potential (ERP) domain. The results show that EEG during tACS can 
      be recovered free of large scale stimulation artifacts. Previous studies have not 
      quantified the performance of the tACS artifact removal procedures, instead 
      focusing on the removal of second order artifacts such as respiration related 
      oscillations. We focus on the unresolved challenge of removing the first order 
      stimulation artifact, presented with a new multi-stage validation strategy.

      Performance.

AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been used to restore communication and 
      control to people with severe paralysis. However, non-invasive BCIs based on 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) are particularly vulnerable to noise artifacts. These 
      artifacts, including electro-oculogram (EOG), can be orders of magnitude larger 
      than the signal to be detected. Many automated methods have been proposed to 
      remove EOG and other artifacts from EEG recordings, most based on blind source 
      separation. This work presents a performance comparison of ten different 
      automated artifact removal methods. Unfortunately, all tested methods 
      substantially and significantly reduced P3 Speller BCI performance, and all 
      methods were more likely to reduce performance than increase it. The least 
      harmful methods were titled SOBI, JADER, and EFICA, but even these methods caused 
      an average of approximately ten percentage points drop in BCI accuracy. Possible 
      mechanistic causes for this empirical performance deduction are proposed.

TI  - Delirium detection using relative delta power based on 1-minute single-channel 
      EEG: a multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is frequently unrecognised. EEG shows slower frequencies 
      (i.e. below 4 Hz) during delirium, which might be useful in improving delirium 
      recognition. We studied the discriminative performance of a brief single-channel 
      EEG recording for delirium detection in an independent cohort of patients. 
      METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre study, postoperative patients aged ≥60 
      yr were included (n=159). Before operation and during the first 3 postoperative 
      days, patients underwent a 5-min EEG recording, followed by a video-recorded 
      standardised cognitive assessment. Two or, in case of disagreement, three 
      delirium experts classified each postoperative day based on the video and chart 
      review. Relative delta power (1-4 Hz) was based on 1-min artifact-free EEG. The 
      diagnostic value of the relative delta power was evaluated by the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), using the expert classification 
      as the gold standard. RESULTS: Experts classified 84 (23.3%) postoperative days 
      as either delirium or possible delirium, and 276 (76.7%) non-delirium days. The 
      AUROC of the relative EEG delta power was 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.69-0.82]. Exploratory analysis showed that relative power from 1 to 6 Hz had 
      significantly higher AUROC (0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.84, P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Delirium/possible delirium can be detected in older postoperative patients based 
      on a single-channel EEG recording that can be automatically analysed. This 
      objective detection method with a continuous scale instead of a dichotomised

AB  - Recent advances in dry electrodes technology have facilitated the recording of 
      EEG in situations not previously possible, thanks to the relatively swift 
      electrode preparation and avoidance of applying gel to subject's hair. However, 
      to become a true alternative, these systems should be compared to 
      state-of-the-art wet EEG systems commonly used in clinical or research 
      applications. In our study, we conducted a systematic comparison of electrodes 
      application speed, subject comfort, and most critically electrophysiological 
      signal quality between the conventional and wired Biosemi EEG system using wet 
      active electrodes and the compact and wireless F1 EEG system consisting of dry 
      passive electrodes. All subjects (n = 27) participated in two recording sessions 
      on separate days, one with the wet EEG system and one with the dry EEG system, in 
      which the session order was counterbalanced across subjects. In each session, we 
      recorded their EEG during separate rest periods with eyes open and closed 
      followed by two versions of a serial visual presentation target detection task. 
      Each task component allows for a neural measure reflecting different 
      characteristics of the data, including spectral power in canonical low frequency 
      bands, event-related potential components (specifically, the P3b), and single 
      trial classification based on machine learning. The performance across the two 
      systems was similar in most measures, including the P3b amplitude and topography, 
      as well as low frequency (theta, alpha, and beta) spectral power at rest. Both 
      EEG systems performed well above chance in the classification analysis, with a 
      marginal advantage of the wet system over the dry. Critically, all aforementioned 
      electrophysiological metrics showed significant positive correlations 
      (r = 0.54-0.89) between the two EEG systems. This multitude of measures provides 
      a comprehensive comparison that captures different aspects of EEG data, including 
      temporal precision, frequency domain as well as multivariate patterns of 
      activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the dry EEG system used in 
      this experiment can effectively record electrophysiological measures commonly 
      used across the research and clinical contexts with comparable quality to the 
      conventional wet EEG system.

AB  - Neurofeedback (NFB) is a real-time paradigm, where subjects learn to volitionally 
      modulate their own brain activity recorded with electroencephalographic (EEG), 
      magnetoencephalographic (MEG) or other functional brain imaging techniques and 
      presented to them via one of sensory modalities: visual, auditory or tactile. NFB 
      has been proposed as an approach to treat neurological conditions and augment 
      brain functions. Although the early NFB studies date back nearly six decades ago, 
      there is still much debate regarding the efficiency of this approach and the ways 
      it should be implemented. Partly, the existing controversy is due to suboptimal 
      conditions under which the NFB training is undertaken. Therefore, new 
      experimental tools attempting to provide optimal or close to optimal training 
      conditions are needed to further exploration of NFB paradigms and comparison of 
      their effects across subjects and training days. To this end, we have developed 
      open-source NFBLab, a versatile, Python-based software for conducting NFB 
      experiments with completely reproducible paradigms and low-latency feedback 
      presentation. Complex experimental protocols can be configured using the GUI and 
      saved in NFBLab's internal XML-based language that describes signal processing 
      tracts, experimental blocks and sequences including randomization of experimental 
      blocks. NFBLab implements interactive modules that enable individualized EEG/MEG 
      signal processing tracts specification using spatial and temporal filters for 
      feature selection and artifacts removal. NFBLab supports direct interfacing to 
      MNE-Python software to facilitate source-space NFB based on individual head 
      models and properly tailored individual inverse solvers. In addition to the 
      standard algorithms for extraction of brain rhythms dynamics from EEG and MEG 
      data, NFBLab implements several novel in-house signal processing algorithms that 
      afford significant reduction in latency of feedback presentation and may 
      potentially improve training effects. The software also supports several standard 
      BCI paradigms. To interface with external data acquisition devices NFBLab employs 
      Lab Streaming Layer protocol supported by the majority of EEG vendors. MEG 
      devices are interfaced through the Fieldtrip buffer.

AB  - Neuroscience is developing rapidly by providing a variety of modern tools for 
      analyzing the functional interactions of the brain and detection of pathological 
      deviations due to neurodegeneration. The present study argues that the induction 
      of neuroplasticity of the mature human brain leads to the prevention of dementia. 
      Promising solution seems to be the dance programs because they combine cognitive 
      and physical activity in a pleasant way. So, we investigated whether the 
      traditional Greek dances can improve the cognitive, physical and functional 
      status of the elderly always aiming at promoting active and healthy aging. 
      Forty-four participants were randomly assigned equally to the training group and 
      an active control group. The duration of the program was 6 months. Also, the 
      participants were evaluated for their physical status and through an 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) examination at rest (eyes-closed condition). The 
      EEG testing was performed 1-14 days before (pre) and after (post) the training. 
      Cortical network analysis was applied by modeling the cortex through a generic 
      anatomical model of 20,000 fixed dipoles. These were grouped into 512 cortical 
      regions of interest (ROIs). High quality, artifact-free data resulting from an 
      elaborate pre-processing pipeline were segmented into multiple, 30 s of 
      continuous epochs. Then, functional connectivity among those ROIs was performed 
      for each epoch through the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). Synchronization 
      matrices were computed and then thresholded in order to provide binary, directed 
      cortical networks of various density ranges. The results showed that the dance 
      training improved optimal network performance as estimated by the small-world 
      property. Further analysis demonstrated that there were also local network 
      changes resulting in better information flow and functional re-organization of 
      the network nodes. These results indicate the application of the dance training 
      as a possible non-pharmacological intervention for promoting mental and physical 
      well-being of senior citizens. Our results were also compared with a combination 
      of computerized cognitive and physical training, which has already been 
      demonstrated to induce neuroplasticity (LLM Care).

TI  - An Approach for Brain-Controlled Prostheses Based on a Facial Expression 
      Paradigm.

AB  - One of the most exciting areas of rehabilitation research is brain-controlled 
      prostheses, which translate electroencephalography (EEG) signals into control 
      commands that operate prostheses. However, the existing brain-control methods 
      have an obstacle between the selection of brain computer interface (BCI) and its 
      performance. In this paper, a novel BCI system based on a facial expression 
      paradigm is proposed to control prostheses that uses the characteristics of theta 
      and alpha rhythms of the prefrontal and motor cortices. A portable 
      brain-controlled prosthesis system was constructed to validate the feasibility of 
      the facial-expression-based BCI (FE-BCI) system. Four types of facial expressions 
      were used in this study. An effective filtering algorithm based on noise-assisted 
      multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and sample entropy (SampEn) 
      was used to remove electromyography (EMG) artifacts. A wavelet transform (WT) was 
      applied to calculate the feature set, and a back propagation neural network 
      (BPNN) was employed as a classifier. To prove the effectiveness of the FE-BCI 
      system for prosthesis control, 18 subjects were involved in both offline and 
      online experiments. The grand average accuracy over 18 subjects was 81.31 ± 5.82% 
      during the online experiment. The experimental results indicated that the 
      proposed FE-BCI system achieved good performance and can be efficiently applied 
      for prosthesis control.

TI  - The Effects of Global Signal Regression on Estimates of Resting-State Blood 
      Oxygen-Level-Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 
      Electroencephalogram Vigilance Correlations.
PG  - 618-627
LID - 10.1089/brain.2018.0645 [doi]
AB  - Global signal regression (GSR) is a commonly used although controversial 
      preprocessing approach in the analysis of resting-state blood oxygenation 
      level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. 
      Although the effects of GSR on resting-state functional connectivity measures 
      have received much attention, there has been relatively little attention devoted 
      to its effects on studies looking at the relationship between resting-state BOLD 
      measures and independent measures of brain activity. In this study, we used 
      simultaneously acquired electroencephalogram (EEG)-fMRI data in humans to examine 
      the effects of GSR on the correlation between resting-state BOLD fluctuations and 
      EEG vigilance measures. We show that GSR leads to a positive shift in the 
      correlation between the BOLD and vigilance measures. This shift leads to a 
      reduction in the spatial extent of negative correlations in widespread brain 
      areas, including the visual cortex, but leads to the appearance of positive 
      correlations in other areas, such as the cingulate gyrus. The results obtained 
      using GSR are consistent with those of a temporal censoring process in which the 
      correlation is computed using a temporal subset of the data. Since the data from 
      these retained time points are unaffected by the censoring process, this finding 
      suggests that the positive correlations in cingulate gyrus are not simply an 
      artifact of GSR.

AB  - Fixation-related potentials (FRPs) enable examination of electrophysiological 
      signatures of visual perception under naturalistic conditions, providing a neural 
      snapshot of the fixated scene. The most prominent FRP component, commonly 
      referred to as the lambda response, is a large deflection over occipital 
      electrodes (O1, Oz, O2) peaking 80-100 ms post fixation, reflecting afferent 
      input to visual cortex. The lambda response is affected by bottom-up stimulus 
      features and the size of the preceding saccade; however, prior research has not 
      adequately controlled for these influences in free viewing paradigms. The current 
      experiment (N = 16, 1 female) addresses these concerns by systematically 
      manipulating spatial frequency in a free-viewing task requiring a range of 
      saccade sizes. Given the close temporal proximity between saccade related 
      activity and the onset of the lambda response, we evaluate how removing 
      independent components (IC) associated with ocular motion artifacts affects 
      lambda response amplitude. Our results indicate that removing ocular artifact ICs 
      based on the covariance with gaze position did not significantly affect the 
      amplitude of this occipital potential. Moreover, the results showed that spatial 
      frequency and saccade magnitude each produce significant effects on lambda 
      amplitude, where amplitude decreased with increasing spatial frequency and 
      increased as a function of saccade size for small and medium-sized saccades. The 
      amplitude differences between spatial frequencies were maintained across all 
      saccade magnitudes suggesting these effects are produced from distinctly 
      different and uncorrelated mechanisms. The current results will inform future 
      analyses of the lambda potential in natural scenes where saccade magnitudes and 
      spatial frequencies ultimately vary.

TI  - The Effect of Electroencephalography Leads on Image Quality in Cerebral Perfusion 
      SPECT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT.
PG  - 359-361
LID - 10.2967/jnmt.117.207621 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral perfusion SPECT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT are commonly performed diagnostic 
      procedures for patients with epilepsy. Individuals undergoing these tests are 
      often inpatients with electroencephalography leads. We have routinely removed 
      these leads because of concern that they would lead to imaging artifacts. The 
      leads would then be replaced at the conclusion of the scan. The goal of our study 
      was to determine whether the electroencephalography leads actually do cause 
      artifacts that can lead to erroneous scan interpretation or make the scan 
      uninterpretable. Methods: (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (99m)Tc-pertechnetate SPECT were 
      performed on a 2-dimensional brain phantom. The phantom was scanned with standard 
      leads, CT/MR-compatible leads, and no leads. The quality of the images was ranked 
      by 3 experienced nuclear medicine physicians, who then determined whether they 
      could differentiate each of the scans from a scan in which it was known that no 
      leads were present. Results: No differences could be detected between scans 
      obtained without leads and scans obtained with either set of leads. The standard 
      electroencephalography leads did create artifacts in the CT portion of the PET/CT 
      images, whereas the CT/MR-compatible leads did not. Conclusion: This phantom 
      study suggests that electroencephalography leads, whether standard or 
      CT/MR-compatible, do not need to be removed for SPECT or PET procedures. Further 
      study evaluating the effect on actual patient scans would be of value to support 
      this conclusion.

AB  - In real life, behavior is influenced by dynamically changing contextual factors 
      and is rarely limited to simple tasks and binary choices. For a meaningful 
      interpretation of brain dynamics underlying more natural cognitive processing in 
      active humans, ecologically valid test scenarios are essential. To understand 
      whether brain dynamics in restricted artificial lab settings reflect the neural 
      activity in complex natural environments, we systematically tested the auditory 
      event-related P300 in both settings. We developed an integrative approach 
      comprising an initial P300-study in a highly controlled laboratory set-up and a 
      subsequent validation within a realistic driving scenario. Using a simulated 
      dialog with a speech-based input system, increased P300 amplitudes reflected 
      processing of infrequent and incorrect auditory feedback events in both the 
      laboratory setting and the real world setup. Environmental noise and 
      movement-related activity in the car driving scenario led to higher data 
      rejection rates but revealed comparable theta and alpha frequency band pattern. 
      Our results demonstrate the possibility to investigate cognitive functions like 
      context updating in highly artifact prone driving scenarios and encourage the 
      consideration of more realistic task settings in prospective brain imaging 
      approaches.

AB  - In patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsies investigated with 
      intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), direct electrical stimulations of a 
      cortical region induce cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEP) in distant 
      cerebral cortex, which properties can be used to infer large scale brain 
      connectivity. In 2013, we proposed a new probabilistic functional tractography 
      methodology to study human brain connectivity. We have now been revisiting this 
      method in the F-TRACT project (f-tract.eu) by developing a large multicenter CCEP 
      database of several thousand stimulation runs performed in several hundred 
      patients, and associated processing tools to create a probabilistic atlas of 
      human cortico-cortical connections. Here, we wish to present a snapshot of the 
      methods and data of F-TRACT using a pool of 213 epilepsy patients, all studied by 
      stereo-encephalography with intracerebral depth electrodes. The CCEPs were 
      processed using an automated pipeline with the following consecutive steps: 
      detection of each stimulation run from stimulation artifacts in raw intracranial 
      EEG (iEEG) files, bad channels detection with a machine learning approach, 
      model-based stimulation artifact correction, robust averaging over stimulation 
      pulses. Effective connectivity between the stimulated and recording areas is then 
      inferred from the properties of the first CCEP component, i.e. onset and peak 
      latency, amplitude, duration and integral of the significant part. Finally, group 
      statistics of CCEP features are implemented for each brain parcel explored by 
      iEEG electrodes. The localization (coordinates, white/gray matter relative 
      positioning) of electrode contacts were obtained from imaging data (anatomical 
      MRI or CT scans before and after electrodes implantation). The iEEG contacts were 
      repositioned in different brain parcellations from the segmentation of patients' 
      anatomical MRI or from templates in the MNI coordinate system. The F-TRACT 
      database using the first pool of 213 patients provided connectivity probability 
      values for 95% of possible intrahemispheric and 56% of interhemispheric 
      connections and CCEP features for 78% of intrahemisheric and 14% of 
      interhemispheric connections. In this report, we show some examples of 
      anatomo-functional connectivity matrices, and associated directional maps. We 
      also indicate how CCEP features, especially latencies, are related to spatial 
      distances, and allow estimating the velocity distribution of neuronal signals at 
      a large scale. Finally, we describe the impact on the estimated connectivity of 
      the stimulation charge and of the contact localization according to the white or 
      gray matter. The most relevant maps for the scientific community are available 
      for download on f-tract. eu (David et al., 2017) and will be regularly updated 
      during the following months with the addition of more data in the F-TRACT 
      database. This will provide an unprecedented knowledge on the dynamical 
      properties of large fiber tracts in human.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emotion recognition is an increasingly important field of research in 
      brain computer interactions. INTRODUCTION: With the advance of technology, 
      automatic emotion recognition systems no longer seem far-fetched. Be that as it 
      may, detecting neural correlates of emotion has remained a substantial 
      bottleneck. Settling this issue will be a breakthrough of significance in the 
      literature. METHODS: The current study aims to identify the correlations between 
      different emotions and brain regions with the help of suitable electrodes. 
      Initially, independent component analysis algorithm is employed to remove 
      artifacts and extract the independent components. The informative channels are 
      then selected based on the thresholded average activity value for obtained 
      components. Afterwards, effective features are extracted from selected channels 
      common between all emotion classes. Features are reduced using the local subset 
      feature selection method and then fed to a new classification model using 
      modified Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. RESULTS: The presented method is 
      employed to DEAP dataset and the results are compared to those of previous 
      studies, which highlights the significant ability of this method to recognize 
      emotions through electroencephalography, by the accuracy of about 91%. Finally, 
      the obtained results are discussed and new aspects are introduced. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The present study addresses the long-standing challenge of finding neural 
      correlates between human emotions and the activated brain regions. Also, we 
      managed to solve uncertainty problem in emotion classification which is one of 
      the most challenging issues in this field. The proposed method could be employed 
      in other practical applications in future.

LID - 879
AB  - Background: Traditional studies on the neural mechanisms of tremor use coherence 
      analysis to investigate the relationship between cortical and muscle activity, 
      measured by electroencephalograms (EEG) and electromyograms (EMG). This 
      methodology is limited by the need of relatively long signal recordings, and it 
      is sensitive to EEG artifacts. Here, we analytically derive and experimentally 
      validate a new method for automatic extraction of the tremor-related EEG 
      component in pathological tremor patients that aims to overcome these 
      limitations. Methods: We exploit the coupling between the tremor-related cortical 
      activity and motor unit population firings to build a linear minimum mean square 
      error estimator of the tremor component in EEG. We estimated the motor unit 
      population activity by decomposing surface EMG signals into constituent motor 
      unit spike trains, which we summed up into a cumulative spike train (CST). We 
      used this CST to initialize our tremor-related EEG component estimate, which we 
      optimized using a novel approach proposed here. Results: Tests on simulated 
      signals demonstrate that our new method is robust to both noise and motor unit 
      firing variability, and that it performs well across a wide range of spectral 
      characteristics of the tremor. Results on 9 essential (ET) and 9 Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) patients show a ~2-fold increase in amplitude of the coherence 
      between the estimated EEG component and the CST, compared to the classical 
      EEG-EMG coherence analysis. Conclusions: We have developed a novel method that 
      allows for more precise and robust estimation of the tremor-related EEG 
      component. This method does not require artifact removal, provides reliable 
      results in relatively short datasets, and tracks changes in the tremor-related 
      cortical activity over time.

TI  - Reducing the Effect of Spurious Phase Variations in Neural Oscillatory Signals.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.3389/fncom.2018.00082 [doi]
LID - 82
AB  - The phase-reset model of oscillatory EEG activity has received a lot of attention 
      in the last decades for decoding different cognitive processes. Based on this 
      model, the ERPs are assumed to be generated as a result of phase reorganization 
      in ongoing EEG. Alignment of the phase of neuronal activities can be observed 
      within or between different assemblies of neurons across the brain. Phase 
      synchronization has been used to explore and understand perception, attentional 
      binding and considering it in the domain of neuronal correlates of consciousness. 
      The importance of the topic and its vast exploration in different domains of the 
      neuroscience presses the need for appropriate tools and methods for measuring the 
      level of phase synchronization of neuronal activities. Measuring the level of 
      instantaneous phase (IP) synchronization has been used extensively in numerous 
      studies of ERPs as well as oscillatory activity for a better understanding of the 
      underlying cognitive binding with regard to different set of stimulations such as 
      auditory and visual. However, the reliability of results can be challenged as a 
      result of noise artifact in IP. Phase distortion due to environmental noise 
      artifacts as well as different pre-processing steps on signals can lead to 
      generation of artificial phase jumps. One of such effects presented recently is 
      the effect of low envelope on the IP of signal. It has been shown that as the 
      instantaneous envelope of the analytic signal approaches zero, the variations in 
      the phase increase, effectively leading to abrupt transitions in the phase. These 
      abrupt transitions can distort the phase synchronization results as they are not 
      related to any neurophysiological effect. These transitions are called spurious 
      phase variation. In this study, we present a model to remove generated artificial 
      phase variations due to the effect of low envelope. The proposed method is based 
      on a simplified form of a Kalman smoother, that is able to model the IP behavior 
      in narrow-bandpassed oscillatory signals. In this work we first explain the 
      details of the proposed Kalman smoother for modeling the dynamics of the phase 
      variations in narrow-bandpassed signals and then evaluate it on a set of 
      synthetic signals. Finally, we apply the model on ongoing-EEG signals to assess 
      the removal of spurious phase variations.

AB  - A longstanding challenge in epilepsy research and practice is the need to 
      classify synchronization patterns hidden in multivariate electroencephalography 
      (EEG) data that is routinely superimposed with intensive noise. It is essential 
      to select a suitable feature extraction method to achieve high recognition 
      performance. A typical approach is to extract the mutual information (MI) between 
      pairs of channels. This calculation, which considers the differences between the 
      sequence pairs to build a reasonable partition, can improve the classification 
      performance. On this basis, however, it is even more difficult to adaptively 
      classify the synchronization patterns hidden in multivariate EEG data under 
      circumstances of insufficient a priori knowledge of domain dependency, such as 
      denoising, feature extraction on a special patient, etc. To address these 
      problems by (1) effectively calculating the MI matrix (synchronization pattern) 
      and (2) accurately classifying the seizure or non-seizure state, this study first 
      accurately measures the synchronization between channel pairs in terms of 
      affinity propagation clustering partition MI (APCPMI). The global synchronization 
      measurement is then obtained by organizing APCPMIs of all channel pairs into a 
      correlation matrix. Finally, a cross-layer fully connected net is designed to 
      characterize the synchronization dynamics correlation matrices adaptively and 
      identify seizure or non-seizure states automatically. Experiments are performed 
      using the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset to evaluate the proposed approach. Seizure 
      states are identified with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9793 ± 
      0.002, 0.9942 ± 0.0005, and 0.9676 ± 0.003, respectively; the resulting 
      performance is superior to those achieved by most existing methods over the same 
      dataset. Furthermore, the approach alleviates the necessity for strictly 
      preprocessing (denoising, removing interferences and artifacts) the EEG data 
      using prior knowledge, which is usually required by existing approaches.

TI  - Evaluating the Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Cerebral 
      Palsy Children by Employing Electroencephalogram Signals.
PG  - 280-284

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new tool that has been 
      employed to modulate the neuronal activity of brain by its excitatory and 
      inhibitory property. In cerebral palsy (CP) learning of any new task is an 
      extremely slow process due to damage in sensory and motor areas of brain 
      affecting the cognitive ability of the child and putting constraints in achieving 
      timely developmental milestones. For such patients the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      is one of the most cost effective diagnostic tools used that minimizes hospital 
      stay. Its analysis helps to identify various neurological disorders determining 
      the role of brain waves outlining the present status of mind. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This study evaluated the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) of CP children 
      both pre and post rTMS intervention to identify significance changes in signal 
      patterns arising from different brain regions. thirty CP children participated in 
      this study. Fifteen individuals underwent repetitive TMS (rTMS) therapy for 20 
      session comprising of 10 Hz frequency for 5 days a week for 4 weeks and another 
      fifteen individual participated in activities of daily living for 20 sessions 
      where they were administered mandatory standard therapy only. pre- EEG versus 
      post EEG data recorded and analyzed employing the standard montage configuration. 
      PSD was extracted employing fast fourier transform post acquisition of artifact 
      free signal to undermine changes in signal pattern. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: 
      The results revealed that rTMS improves learning ability in CP children and it 
      shows higher power peak at frequency of 50 Hz and lower power peak frequency at 
      100 Hz. The power intensity in gamma wave region shows significant reduction 
      post-rTMS therapy between 38-24 power peak frequency and 7-4 range in 100 Hz 
      power peak frequency. In future, it will be used as effective tool as memory 
      enhancers, especially for children with neurological disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE: Quasi-stable electrical distribution in EEG called microstates could 
      carry useful information on the dynamics of large scale brain networks. Using 
      machine learning techniques we explored if abnormalities in microstates can 
      identify patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) in the absence of an 
      interictal discharge (IED). METHOD: 4 Classes of microstates were computed from 
      2 min artefact free EEG epochs in 42 subjects (21 TLE and 21 controls). The 
      percentage of time coverage, frequency of occurrence and duration for each of 
      these microstates were computed and redundancy reduced using feature selection 
      methods. Subsequently, Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and logistic 
      regression were used for classification. RESULT: FLDA distinguished TLE with 
      76.1% accuracy (85.0% sensitivity, 66.6% specificity) considering frequency of 
      occurrence and percentage of time coverage of microstate C as features. 
      CONCLUSION: Microstate alterations are present in patients with TLE. This feature 
      might be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy even in the absence of an IED.

LID - 680
AB  - High accuracy decoding of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is still a major 
      challenge that can hardly be solved in the design of an effective motor 
      imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI), especially when the signal contains 
      various extreme artifacts and outliers arose from data loss. The conventional 
      process to avoid such cases is to directly reject the entire severely 
      contaminated EEG segments, which leads to a drawback that the BCI has no decoding 
      results during that certain period. In this study, a novel decoding scheme based 
      on the combination of Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) and deep belief network 
      (DBN) was proposed to recognize the incomplete motor imagery EEG. Particularly, 
      instead of discarding the entire segment, two forms of data removal were adopted 
      to eliminate the EEG portions with extreme artifacts and data loss. The LSP was 
      utilized to steadily extract the power spectral density (PSD) features from the 
      incomplete EEG constructed by the remaining portions. A DBN structure based on 
      the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was exploited and optimized to perform the 
      classification task. Various comparative experiments were conducted and evaluated 
      on simulated signal and real incomplete motor imagery EEG, including the 
      comparison of three PSD extraction methods (fast Fourier transform, Welch and 
      LSP) and two classifiers (DBN and support vector machine, SVM). The results 
      demonstrate that the LSP can estimate relative robust PSD features and the 
      proposed scheme can significantly improve the decoding performance for the 
      incomplete motor imagery EEG. This scheme can provide an alternative decoding 
      solution for the motor imagery EEG contaminated by extreme artifacts and data 
      loss. It can be beneficial to promote the stability, smoothness and maintain 
      consecutive outputs without interruption for a BCI system that is suitable for 
      the online and long-term application.

TI  - A Method for Simultaneous Evaluation of Muscular and Neural Prepulse Inhibition.
PG  - 654

LID - 654
AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) test has been widely used to evaluate sensorimotor 
      gating. In humans, deficits in this mechanism are measured through the 
      orbicularis muscle response using electromyography (EMG). Although this mechanism 
      can be modulated by several brain structures and is impaired in some pathologies 
      as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, neural PPI evaluation is rarely performed 
      in humans. Since eye blinks are a consequence of PPI stimulation, they strongly 
      contaminate the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. This paper describes a method 
      to reduce muscular artifacts and enable neural PPI assessment through EEG in 
      parallel to muscular PPI evaluation using EMG. Both types of signal were 
      simultaneously recorded in 22 healthy subjects. PPI was evaluated by the 
      acoustical startle response with EMG and by the P2-N1 event-related potential 
      (ERP) using EEG in Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes. In order to remove EEG artifacts, 
      Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed using two methods. Firstly, 
      visual inspection discarded components containing artifact characteristics as 
      ocular and tonic muscle artifacts. The second method used visual inspection as 
      gold standard to validate parameters in an automated component selection using 
      the SASICA algorithm. As an outcome, EEG artifacts were effectively removed and 
      equivalent neural PPI evaluation performance was obtained using both methods, 
      with subjects exhibiting consistent neural as well as muscular PPI. This novel 
      method improves PPI test, enabling neural gating mechanisms assessment within the 
      latency of 100-200 ms, which is not evaluated by other sensory gating tests as 
      P50 and mismatch negativity.

TI  - EEG-Based Automatic Sleep Staging Using Ontology and Weighting Feature Analysis.
PG  - 6534041

AB  - Sleep staging is considered as an effective indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of 
      sleep diseases and related psychiatric diseases, so it attracts a lot of 
      attention from sleep researchers. Nevertheless, sleep staging based on visual 
      inspection of tradition is subjective, time-consuming, and error-prone due to the 
      large bulk of data which have to be processed. Therefore, automatic sleep staging 
      is essential in order to solve these problems. In this article, an 
      electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based scheme that is able to automatically classify 
      sleep stages is proposed. Firstly, EEG data are preprocessed to remove artifacts, 
      extract features, and normalization. Secondly, the normalized features and other 
      context information are stored using an ontology-based model (OBM). Thirdly, an 
      improved method of self-adaptive correlation analysis is designed to select the 
      most effective EEG features. Based on these EEG features and weighting features 
      analysis, the improved random forest (RF) is considered as the classifier to 
      achieve the classification of sleep stages. To investigate the classification 
      ability of the proposed method, several sets of experiments are designed and 
      conducted to classify the sleep stages into two, three, four, and five states. 
      The accuracy of five-state classification is 89.37%, which is improved compared 
      to the accuracy using unimproved RF (84.37%) or previously reported classifiers. 
      In addition, a set of controlled experiments is executed to verify the effect of 
      the number of sleep segments (epochs) on the classification, and the results 
      demonstrate that the proposed scheme is less affected by the sleep segments.

TI  - An error-aware gaze-based keyboard by means of a hybrid BCI system.
PG  - 13176

AB  - Gaze-based keyboards offer a flexible way for human-computer interaction in both 
      disabled and able-bodied people. Besides their convenience, they still lead to 
      error-prone human-computer interaction. Eye tracking devices may misinterpret 
      user's gaze resulting in typesetting errors, especially when operated in fast 
      mode. As a potential remedy, we present a novel error detection system that 
      aggregates the decision from two distinct subsystems, each one dealing with 
      disparate data streams. The first subsystem operates on gaze-related measurements 
      and exploits the eye-transition pattern to flag a typo. The second, is a 
      brain-computer interface that utilizes a neural response, known as Error-Related 
      Potentials (ErrPs), which is inherently generated whenever the subject observes 
      an erroneous action. Based on the experimental data gathered from 10 participants 
      under a spontaneous typesetting scenario, we first demonstrate that ErrP-based 
      Brain Computer Interfaces can be indeed useful in the context of gaze-based 
      typesetting, despite the putative contamination of EEG activity from the 
      eye-movement artefact. Then, we show that the performance of this subsystem can 
      be further improved by considering also the error detection from the gaze-related 
      subsystem. Finally, the proposed bimodal error detection system is shown to 
      significantly reduce the typesetting time in a gaze-based keyboard.

AB  - Detection of epileptic seizure activities from long-term multi-channel 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a significant role in the timely 
      treatment of the patients with epilepsy. Visual identification of epileptic 
      seizure in long-term EEG is cumbersome and tedious for neurologists, which might 
      also lead to human error. Therefore, an automated tool for accurate detection of 
      seizures in a long-term multi-channel EEG is essential for the clinical 
      diagnosis. This study proposes an algorithm using multi-features and multilayer 
      perceptron neural network (MLPNN) classifier. After appropriate approval from the 
      ethical committee, recordings of EEG data were collected from the Institute of 
      Neurosciences, Ramaiah Memorial College and Hospital, Bengaluru. Initially, 
      preprocessing was performed to remove the power-line noise and motion artifacts. 
      Four features, namely power spectral density (Yule-Walker), entropy (Shannon and 
      Renyi), and Teager energy, were extracted. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and 
      descriptive analysis ensure the suitability of the proposed features for pattern 
      classification. Single and multi-features were fed to the MLPNN classifier to 
      evaluate the performance of the study. The simulation results showed sensitivity, 
      specificity, and false detection rate of 97.1%, 97.8%, and 1 h(-1), respectively, 
      using multi-features. Further, the results indicate the proposed study is 
      suitable for real-time seizure recognition from multi-channel EEG recording. The 
      graphical user interface was developed in MATLAB to provide an automated 
      biomarker for normal and epileptic EEG signals.

TI  - Hemodynamic state of periictal hyperperfusion revealed by arterial spin-labeling 
      perfusion MR images with dual postlabeling delay.
PG  - 5-18
LID - 10.1016/j.ensci.2018.06.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including perfusion MRI with 
      arterial spin labeling (ASL) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), are applied in 
      the periictal detection of circulatory and metabolic consequences associated with 
      epilepsy. Although previous report revealed that prolonged ictal hyperperfusion 
      on ASL can be firstly detected and cortical hyperintensity of cytotoxic edema on 
      DWI secondarily obtained from an epileptically activated cortex, the hemodynamic 
      state of the periictal hyperperfusion has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS 
      STUDY-1: We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between seizure 
      manifestations and the development of periictal MRI findings, in Case 1 with 
      symptomatic partial epilepsy, who underwent repeated periictal ASL/DWI 
      examination for three epileptic ictuses (one examination for each ictus). 
      Study-2: We evaluated the hemodynamic state of periictal hyperperfusion with the 
      ASL technique using a dual postlabeling delay (PLD) of 1.5 and 2.5 s in nine 
      patients, according to the presence or absence of the localized epileptogenic 
      lesion (EL) on conventional 3 T-MRI, who were divided into Group EL+ (six 
      patients) and Group EL- (three patients). RESULTS: Study-1 confirmed that the 
      stratified representation of the periictal MRI findings depends on the time 
      interval between the ictal cessation and MRI examination in addition to the 
      magnitude and duration of the epileptic activity. In Study-2, two types of 
      periictal hyperperfusion were noted. In all six Group EL+ patients, periictal ASL 
      findings showed "fast flow type". Markedly increased ASL signals were noted at 
      the epileptically activated cortex, having a tight topographical relationship 
      with EL, on ASL with a PLD of 1.5 s, which is decreased on ASL with a PLD of 
      2.5 s. In all three Group EL- patients, periictal ASL findings showed "gradual 
      flow type", which is characterized by gradual signal increase of the 
      epileptically activated cortex on ASL with a PLD of 1.5 and 2.5 s. CONCLUSION: We 
      confirmed that ASL hyperperfusion is superior to DWI in the periictal detection 
      of epileptic events. ASL with dual PLD offers the ability to document two types 
      of hemodynamics of periictal hyperperfusion.

AB  - Recently, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) multimodal fusion has been pursued in an effort to study human 
      brain function and dysfunction to obtain more comprehensive information on brain 
      activity in which the spatial and temporal resolutions are both satisfactory. 
      However, a more flexible and easy-to-use toolbox for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion 
      is still lacking. In this study, we therefore developed a freely available and 
      open-source MATLAB graphical user interface toolbox, known as the Neuroscience 
      Information Toolbox (NIT), for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion analysis. The NIT 
      consists of three modules: (1) the fMRI module, which has batch fMRI 
      preprocessing, nuisance signal removal, bandpass filtering, and calculation of 
      resting-state measures; (2) the EEG module, which includes artifact removal, 
      extracting EEG features (event onset, power, and amplitude), and marking 
      interesting events; and (3) the fusion module, in which fMRI-informed EEG 
      analysis and EEG-informed fMRI analysis are included. The NIT was designed to 
      provide a convenient and easy-to-use toolbox for researchers, especially for 
      novice users. The NIT can be downloaded for free at 
      http://www.neuro.uestc.edu.cn/NIT.html, and detailed information, including the 
      introduction of NIT, user's manual and example data sets, can also be observed on 
      this website. We hope that the NIT is a promising toolbox for exploring brain 
      information in various EEG and fMRI studies.

TI  - Combined Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Electroencephalography of the 
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.
LID - 10.3791/57983 [doi]
LID - 57983
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method that produces 
      neural excitation in the cortex by means of brief, time-varying magnetic field 
      pulses. The initiation of cortical activation or its modulation depends on the 
      background activation of the neurons of the cortical region activated, the 
      characteristics of the coil, its position and its orientation with respect to the 
      head. TMS combined with simultaneous electrocephalography (EEG) and 
      neuronavigation (nTMS-EEG) allows for the assessment of cortico-cortical 
      excitability and connectivity in almost all cortical areas in a reproducible 
      manner. This advance makes nTMS-EEG a powerful tool that can accurately assess 
      brain dynamics and neurophysiology in test-retest paradigms that are required for 
      clinical trials. Limitations of this method include artifacts that cover the 
      initial brain reactivity to stimulation. Thus, the process of removing artifacts 
      may also extract valuable information. Moreover, the optimal parameters for 
      dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) stimulation are not fully known and current 
      protocols utilize variations from the motor cortex (M1) stimulation paradigms. 
      However, evolving nTMS-EEG designs hope to address these issues. The protocol 
      presented here introduces some standard practices for assessing 
      neurophysiological functioning from stimulation to the DLPFC that can be applied 
      in patients with treatment resistant psychiatric disorders that receive treatment 
      such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST) or electroconvulsive 
      therapy (ECT).

TI  - Suppression of overlearning in independent component analysis used for removal of 
      muscular artifacts from electroencephalographic records.

AB  - This paper addresses the overlearning problem in the independent component 
      analysis (ICA) used for the removal of muscular artifacts from 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) records. We note that for short EEG records with 
      high number of channels the ICA fails to separate artifact-free EEG and muscular 
      artifacts, which has been previously attributed to the phenomenon called 
      overlearning. We address this problem by projecting an EEG record into several 
      subspaces with a lower dimension, and perform the ICA on each subspace 
      separately. Due to a reduced dimension of the subspaces, the overlearning is 
      suppressed, and muscular artifacts are better separated. Once the muscular 
      artifacts are removed, the signals in the individual subspaces are combined to 
      provide an artifact free EEG record. We show that for short signals and high 
      number of EEG channels our approach outperforms the currently available ICA based 
      algorithms for muscular artifact removal. The proposed technique can efficiently 
      suppress ICA overlearning for short signal segments of high density EEG signals.

AB  - High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are thought 
      to be a promising marker for epileptogenicity. A number of automated detection 
      algorithms have been developed for reliable analysis of invasively recorded HFOs. 
      However, invasive recordings are not widely applicable since they bear risks and 
      costs, and the harm of the surgical intervention of implantation needs to be 
      weighted against the informational benefits of the invasive examination. In 
      contrast, scalp EEG is widely available at low costs and does not bear any risks. 
      However, the detection of HFOs on the scalp represents a challenge that was taken 
      on so far mostly via visual detection. Visual detection of HFOs is, in turn, 
      highly time-consuming and subjective. In this review, we discuss that automated 
      detection algorithms for detection of HFOs on the scalp are highly warranted 
      because the available algorithms were all developed for invasively recorded EEG 
      and do not perform satisfactorily in scalp EEG because of the low signal-to-noise 
      ratio and numerous artefacts as well as physiological activity that obscures the 
      tiny phenomena in the high-frequency range.

TI  - A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study of State Anxiety and Auditory 
      Working Memory Load.
PG  - 313

LID - 313
AB  - Cognitive studies have suggested that anxiety is correlated with cognitive 
      performance. Previous research has focused on the relationship between anxiety 
      level and the perceptual load within the frontal region, such as the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. High-anxious individuals are 
      predicted to have worse performance on cognitively-demanding tasks requiring 
      efficient cognitive processing. A few functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      studies have specifically discussed the performance and brain activity involving 
      working memory for high-anxious individuals. This topic has been further explored 
      with electroencephalography, although these studies have mostly provided results 
      involving visual face-related stimuli. In this study, we used auditory 
      stimulation to manipulate the working memory load and attempted to interpret the 
      deficiency of cognitive function in high-anxious participants or patients using 
      functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The fNIRS signals of 30 
      participants were measured while they were performing an auditory working memory 
      task. For the auditory n-back task, there were three experimental conditions, 
      including two n-back task conditions of stimuli memorization with different 
      memory load and a condition of passive listening to the stimuli. Hemodynamic 
      responses from frontal brain regions were recorded using a wireless fNIRS device. 
      Brain activation from the ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex were 
      measured with signals filtered and artifacts removed. The fNIRS signals were then 
      standardized with statistical testing and group analysis was performed. The 
      results revealed that there were significantly stronger hemodynamic responses in 
      the right ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex when subjects were 
      attending to the auditory working memory task with higher load. Furthermore, the 
      right lateralization of the prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated with the 
      level of state anxiety. This study revealed the possibility of incorporating 
      fNIRS signals as an index to evaluate cognitive performance and mood states given 
      its flexibility regarding portable applications compared to other neuroimaging 
      techniques.

LID - e1006177
AB  - The combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) exposes the brain's global response to localized and 
      abrupt stimulations. However, large electric artifacts are induced in the EEG by 
      the TMS, obscuring crucial stages of the brain's response. Artifact removal is 
      commonly performed by data processing techniques. However, an experimentally 
      verified physical model for the origin and structure of the TMS-induced discharge 
      artifacts, by which these methods can be justified or evaluated, is still 
      lacking. We re-examine the known contribution of the skin in creating the 
      artifacts, and outline a detailed model for the relaxation of the charge 
      accumulated at the electrode-gel-skin interface due to the TMS pulse. We then 
      experimentally validate implications set forth by the model. We find that the 
      artifacts decay like a power law in time rather than the commonly assumed 
      exponential. In fact, the skin creates a power-law decay of order 1 at each 
      electrode, which is turned into a power law of order 2 by the reference 
      electrode. We suggest an artifact removal method based on the model which can be 
      applied from times after the pulse as short as 2 milliseconds onwards to expose 
      the full EEG from the brain. The method can separate the capacitive discharge 
      artifacts from those resulting from cranial muscle activation, demonstrating that 
      the capacitive effect dominates at short times. Overall, our insight into the 
      physical process allows us to accurately access TMS-evoked EEG responses that 
      directly follow the TMS pulse, possibly opening new opportunities in TMS-EEG 
      research.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We present an automated sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      spectral analysis pipeline that includes an automated artifact detection step, 
      and we test the hypothesis that spectral power density estimates computed with 
      this pipeline are comparable to those computed with a commercial method preceded 
      by visual artifact detection by a sleep expert (standard approach). METHODS: EEG 
      data were analyzed from the C3-A2 lead in a sample of polysomnograms from 161 
      older women participants in a community-based cohort study. We calculated the 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa measures from 
      epoch-by-epoch comparisons of automated to visual-based artifact detection 
      results; then we computed the average EEG spectral power densities in six 
      commonly used EEG frequency bands and compared results from the two methods using 
      correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: Assessment of automated 
      artifact detection showed high specificity [96.8%-99.4% in non-rapid eye movement 
      (NREM), 96.9%-99.1% in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep] but low sensitivity 
      (26.7%-38.1% in NREM, 9.1-27.4% in REM sleep). However, large artifacts (total 
      power > 99th percentile) were removed with sensitivity up to 87.7% in NREM and 
      90.9% in REM, with specificities of 96.9% and 96.6%, respectively. Mean power 
      densities computed with the two approaches for all EEG frequency bands showed 
      very high correlation (≥0.99). The automated pipeline allowed for a 100-fold 
      reduction in analysis time with regard to the standard approach. CONCLUSION: 
      Despite low sensitivity for artifact rejection, the automated pipeline generated 
      results comparable to those obtained with a standard method that included manual 
      artifact detection. Automated pipelines can enable practical analyses of 
      recordings from thousands of individuals, allowing for use in genetics and 
      epidemiological research requiring large samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In simultaneous EEG-fMRI, identification of the period of 
      cardioballistic artifact (BCG) in EEG is required for the artifact removal. 
      Recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform during fMRI is difficult, often 
      causing inaccurate period detection. NEW METHOD: Since the waveform of the BCG 
      extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) is relatively invariable 
      compared to the ECG waveform, we propose a multiple-scale peak-detection 
      algorithm to determine the BCG cycle directly from the EEG data. The algorithm 
      first extracts the high contrast BCG component from the EEG data by ICA. The BCG 
      cycle is then estimated by band-pass filtering the component around the 
      fundamental frequency identified from its energy spectral density, and the peak 
      of BCG artifact occurrence is selected from each of the estimated cycle. RESULTS: 
      The algorithm is shown to achieve a high accuracy on a large EEG-fMRI dataset. It 
      is also adaptive to various heart rates without the needs of adjusting the 
      threshold parameters. The cycle detection remains accurate with the scan duration 
      reduced to half a minute. Additionally, the algorithm gives a figure of merit to 
      evaluate the reliability of the detection accuracy. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING 
      METHOD: The algorithm is shown to give a higher detection accuracy than the 
      commonly used cycle detection algorithm fmrib_qrsdetect implemented in EEGLAB. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The achieved high cycle detection accuracy of our algorithm without 
      using the ECG waveforms makes possible to create and automate pipelines for 
      processing large EEG-fMRI datasets, and virtually eliminates the need for ECG 
      recordings for BCG artifact removal.

LID - 4
AB  - Dyslexia is a disability that causes difficulties in reading and writing despite 
      average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since 
      dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) 
      is one of the upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain 
      activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and 
      cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and 
      recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A 
      critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework's (1) 
      data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. 
      A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented 
      for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was 
      uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments 
      used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only 
      simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG 
      signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact 
      subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a 
      promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks 
      for dyslexia.

LID - 8902
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during simultaneous functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are contaminated by strong artifacts. Among 
      these, the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact is the most challenging, due to 
      its complex spatio-temporal dynamics associated with ongoing cardiac activity. 
      The presence of BCG residuals in EEG data may hide true, or generate spurious 
      correlations between EEG and fMRI time-courses. Here, we propose an adaptive 
      Optimal Basis Set (aOBS) method for BCG artifact removal. Our method is adaptive, 
      as it can estimate the delay between cardiac activity and BCG occurrence on a 
      beat-to-beat basis. The effective creation of an optimal basis set by principal 
      component analysis (PCA) is therefore ensured by a more accurate alignment of BCG 
      occurrences. Furthermore, aOBS can automatically estimate which components 
      produced by PCA are likely to be BCG artifact-related and therefore need to be 
      removed. The aOBS performance was evaluated on high-density EEG data acquired 
      with simultaneous fMRI in healthy subjects during visual stimulation. As aOBS 
      enables effective reduction of BCG residuals while preserving brain signals, we 
      suggest it may find wide application in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.

TI  - Improvement of Information Transfer Rates Using a Hybrid EEG-NIRS Brain-Computer 
      Interface with a Short Trial Length: Offline and Pseudo-Online Analyses.
LID - 10.3390/s18061827 [doi]
LID - 1827
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are 
      non-invasive neuroimaging methods that record the electrical and metabolic 
      activity of the brain, respectively. Hybrid EEG-NIRS brain-computer interfaces 
      (hBCIs) that use complementary EEG and NIRS information to enhance BCI 
      performance have recently emerged to overcome the limitations of existing 
      unimodal BCIs, such as vulnerability to motion artifacts for EEG-BCI or low 
      temporal resolution for NIRS-BCI. However, with respect to NIRS-BCI, in order to 
      fully induce a task-related brain activation, a relatively long trial length (≥10 
      s) is selected owing to the inherent hemodynamic delay that lowers the 
      information transfer rate (ITR; bits/min). To alleviate the ITR degradation, we 
      propose a more practical hBCI operated by intuitive mental tasks, such as mental 
      arithmetic (MA) and word chain (WC) tasks, performed within a short trial length 
      (5 s). In addition, the suitability of the WC as a BCI task was assessed, which 
      has so far rarely been used in the BCI field. In this experiment, EEG and NIRS 
      data were simultaneously recorded while participants performed MA and WC tasks 
      without preliminary training and remained relaxed (baseline; BL). Each task was 
      performed for 5 s, which was a shorter time than previous hBCI studies. 
      Subsequently, a classification was performed to discriminate MA-related or 
      WC-related brain activations from BL-related activations. By using hBCI in the 
      offline/pseudo-online analyses, average classification accuracies of 90.0 ± 
      7.1/85.5 ± 8.1% and 85.8 ± 8.6/79.5 ± 13.4% for MA vs. BL and WC vs. BL, 
      respectively, were achieved. These were significantly higher than those of the 
      unimodal EEG- or NIRS-BCI in most cases. Given the short trial length and 
      improved classification accuracy, the average ITRs were improved by more than 
      96.6% for MA vs. BL and 87.1% for WC vs. BL, respectively, compared to those 
      reported in previous studies. The suitability of implementing a more practical 
      hBCI based on intuitive mental tasks without preliminary training and with a 
      shorter trial length was validated when compared to previous studies.

AB  - Motion artefacts (MAs) are induced within EEG data collected simultaneously with 
      fMRI when the subject's head rotates relative to the magnetic field. The effects 
      of these artefacts have generally been ameliorated by removing periods of data 
      during which large artefact voltages appear in the EEG traces. However, even when 
      combined with other standard post-processing methods, this strategy does not 
      remove smaller MAs which can dominate the neuronal signals of interest. A number 
      of methods are therefore being developed to characterise the MA by measuring 
      reference signals and then using these in artefact correction. These methods 
      generally assume that the head and EEG cap, plus any attached sensors, form a 
      rigid body which can be characterised by a standard set of six motion parameters. 
      Here we investigate the motion of the head/EEG cap system to provide a better 
      understanding of MAs. We focus on the reference layer artefact subtraction (RLAS) 
      approach, as this allows measurement of a separate reference signal for each 
      electrode that is being used to measure brain activity. Through a series of 
      experiments on phantoms and subjects, we find that movement of the EEG cap 
      relative to the phantom and skin on the forehead is relatively small and that 
      this non-rigid body movement does not appear to cause considerable discrepancy in 
      artefacts between the scalp and reference signals. However, differences in the 
      amplitude of these signals is observed which may be due to differences in 
      geometry of the system from which the reference signals are measured compared 
      with the brain signals. In addition, we find that there is non-rigid body 
      movement of the skull and skin which produces an additional MA component for a 
      head shake, which is not present for a head nod. This results in a large 
      discrepancy in the amplitude and temporal profile of the MA measured on the scalp 
      and reference layer, reducing the efficacy of MA correction based on the 
      reference signals. Together our data suggest that the efficacy of the correction 
      of MA using any reference-based system is likely to differ for different types of 
      head movement with head shake being the hardest to correct. This provides new 
      information to inform the development of hardware and post-processing methods for 
      removing MAs from EEG data acquired simultaneously with fMRI data.

TI  - Towards an Online Seizure Advisory System-An Adaptive Seizure Prediction 
      Framework Using Active Learning Heuristics.
LID - 10.3390/s18061698 [doi]
LID - 1698
AB  - In the last decade, seizure prediction systems have gained a lot of attention 
      because of their enormous potential to largely improve the quality-of-life of the 
      epileptic patients. The accuracy of the prediction algorithms to detect seizure 
      in real-world applications is largely limited because the brain signals are 
      inherently uncertain and affected by various factors, such as environment, age, 
      drug intake, etc., in addition to the internal artefacts that occur during the 
      process of recording the brain signals. To deal with such ambiguity, researchers 
      transitionally use active learning, which selects the ambiguous data to be 
      annotated by an expert and updates the classification model dynamically. However, 
      selecting the particular data from a pool of large ambiguous datasets to be 
      labelled by an expert is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose 
      an active learning-based prediction framework that aims to improve the accuracy 
      of the prediction with a minimum number of labelled data. The core technique of 
      our framework is employing the Bernoulli-Gaussian Mixture model (BGMM) to 
      determine the feature samples that have the most ambiguity to be annotated by an 
      expert. By doing so, our approach facilitates expert intervention as well as 
      increasing medical reliability. We evaluate seven different classifiers in terms 
      of the classification time and memory required. An active learning framework 
      built on top of the best performing classifier is evaluated in terms of required 
      annotation effort to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy. The results 
      show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a Support Vector Machine 
      (SVM) classifier using only 20 % of the labelled data and also improve the 
      prediction accuracy even under the noisy condition.

AB  - The appreciation for the need to record electroencephalographic (EEG) signals 
      from humans while walking has been steadily growing in recent years, particularly 
      in relation to understanding gait disturbances. Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG 
      signals originate from mechanical forces applied to the scalp electrodes, 
      inducing small electrode movements relative to the scalp which, in turn, cause 
      the recorded voltage to change irrespectively of cortical activity. These 
      mechanical forces, and thus MA, may have various sources (e.g., ground reaction 
      forces, head movements, etc.) that are inherent to daily activities, notably 
      walking. In this paper we introduce a systematic, integrated methodology for 
      removing MA from EEG signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground (OG) 
      walking, as well as quantify the prevalence of MA in different locomotion 
      settings. In our experiments, participants performed walking trials at various 
      speeds both OG and on a TM while wearing a 32-channel EEG cap and a 3-axis 
      accelerometer, placed on the forehead. Data preprocessing included separating the 
      EEG signals into statistically independent additive components using independent 
      component analysis (ICA). We observed an increase in electro-physiological 
      signals (e.g., neck EMG activations for stabilizing the head during heel-strikes) 
      as the walking speed increased. These artefact independent-components (ICs), 
      while not originating from electrode movement, still exhibit a similar spectral 
      pattern to the MA ICs-a peak at the stepping frequency. MA was identified and 
      quantified in each component using a novel method that utilizes the participant's 
      stepping frequency, derived from a forehead-mounted accelerometer. We then 
      benchmarked the EEG data by applying newly established metrics to quantify the 
      success of our method in cleaning the data. The results indicate that our 
      approach can be successfully applied to EEG data recorded during TM and OG 
      walking, and is offered as a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG 
      collected during gait trials.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related techniques 
      are prone to glitches, slow drift, steps, etc., that contaminate the data and 
      interfere with the analysis and interpretation. These artifacts are usually 
      addressed in a preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize their 
      impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for this purpose: robust 
      detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier detection, data interpolation 
      (inpainting), step removal, and filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques 
      provide a less wasteful alternative to discarding corrupted trials or channels, 
      and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt alternative approaches 
      such as filtering. Robust detrending allows slow drifts and common mode signals 
      to be factored out while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust 
      rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference. Inpainting allows 
      corrupt data to be interpolated from intact parts based on the correlation 
      structure estimated over the intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt 
      parts to be identified. Step removal fixes the high-amplitude flux jump artifacts 
      that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal allows the ringing 
      response of the antialiasing filter to glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. 
      The performance of the methods is illustrated and evaluated using synthetic data 
      and data from real EEG and MEG systems. These methods, which are mainly automatic 
      and require little tuning, can greatly improve the quality of the data.

TI  - A New Method to Generate Artificial Frames Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition 
      for an EEG-Based Motor Imagery BCI.

AB  - EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are becoming a new tool for 
      neurorehabilitation. BCIs are used to help stroke patients to improve the 
      functional capability of the impaired limbs, and to communicate and assess the 
      level of consciousness in Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) patients. BCIs based on 
      a motor imagery paradigm typically require a training period to adapt the system 
      to each user's brain, and the BCI then creates and uses a classifier created with 
      the acquired EEG. The quality of this classifier relies on amount of data used 
      for training. More data can improve the classifier, but also increases the 
      training time, which can be especially problematic for some patients. Training 
      time might be reduced by creating new artificial frames by applying Empirical 
      Mode Decomposition (EMD) on the EEG frames and mixing their Intrinsic Mode 
      Function (IMFs). The purpose of this study is to explore the use of artificial 
      EEG frames as replacements for some real ones by comparing classifiers trained 
      with some artificial frames to classifiers trained with only real data. Results 
      showed that, in some subjects, it is possible to replace up to 50% of frames with 
      artificial data, which reduces training time from 720 to 360 s. In the remaining 
      subjects, at least 12.5% of the real EEG frames could be replaced, reducing the 
      training time by 90 s. Moreover, the method can be used to replace EEG frames 
      that contain artifact, which reduces the impact of rejecting data with artifact. 
      The method was also tested on an out of sample scenario with the best subjects 
      from a public database, who yielded very good results using a frame collection 
      with 87.5% artificial frames. These initial results with healthy users need to be 
      further explored with patients' data, along with research into alternative IMF 
      mixing strategies and using other BCI paradigms.

AB  - Local field potentials (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) recorded during 
      walking may provide clues for determining the function of the STN during gait and 
      also, may be used as biomarker to steer adaptive brain stimulation devices. Here, 
      we present LFP recordings from an implanted sensing neurostimulator (Medtronic 
      Activa PC + S) during walking and rest with and without stimulation in 10 
      patients with Parkinson's disease and electrodes placed bilaterally in the STN. 
      We also present recordings from two of these patients recorded with externalized 
      leads. We analyzed changes in overall frequency power, bilateral connectivity, 
      high beta frequency oscillatory characteristics and gait-cycle related 
      oscillatory activity. We report that deep brain stimulation improves gait 
      parameters. High beta frequency power (20-30 Hz) and bilateral oscillatory 
      connectivity are reduced during gait, while the attenuation of high beta power is 
      absent during stimulation. Oscillatory characteristics are affected in a similar 
      way. We describe a reduction in overall high beta burst amplitude and burst 
      lifetimes during gait as compared to rest off stimulation. Investigating gait 
      cycle related oscillatory dynamics, we found that alpha, beta and gamma frequency 
      power is modulated in time during gait, locked to the gait cycle. We argue that 
      these changes are related to movement induced artifacts and that these issues 
      have important implications for similar research.

TI  - Effects of Fatigue Based on Electroencephalography Signal during Laparoscopic 
      Surgical Simulation.
PG  - 2389158

AB  - BACKGROUND: Following recent advances in technology, there is a growing interest 
      in studying fatigue based on electrophysiological signals as a means of 
      monitoring brain activity. While some existing works relate fatigue to 
      performance, others consider the two as independent entities. Therefore, we must 
      explore this intricate issue, particularly in laparoscopic training, for the sake 
      of patient safety. OBJECTIVE: This paper explores and evaluates effects of 
      fatigue on efficiency and accuracy based on laparoscopic surgical training using 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) signal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 college students 
      performed peg transfer task on laparoscopic simulator, with real-time recording 
      of EEG signals for each subject. To monitor degree of fatigue, a real-time 
      fatigue monitoring system based on fatigue analysis algorithm was designed 
      through the use of EEG in alpha (α) and theta (θ) rhythms. We designed data 
      acquisition and fatigue analysis modules based on MATLAB platform. BrainLink was 
      used to record EEG signals and send them to personal computer wirelessly via 
      Bluetooth. While artifacts from the captured EEG signals were removed using Blind 
      Source Separation (BSS), α and θ rhythms were extracted using wavelet analysis. 
      Fatigue was evaluated based on Regression Model and Mahalanobis Distance (D(C) ), 
      and its threshold was determined from the experimental results using Receiver 
      Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Completion time and 
      number of errors behaved like a decreasing function during the first few trials 
      while increasing afterwards with the increasing of perceived fatigue level. The 
      results indicate that learning curve of the subjects is increasing until 13th 
      trials when they have attained maximum learning benefits and decreases afterwards 
      due to fatigue. CONCLUSION: Regression analysis shows that there are significant 
      learning and fatigue effects when peg transfer task in the training is repeated 
      in a series of trials. However, for the training to be effective and efficient, 
      there should be monitoring during the training to observe where in the learning 
      curve a trainee gains maximum learning benefits. Furthermore, fatigue is a 
      significant indicator of efficiency and accuracy in terms of completion time and 
      errors, respectively.

AB  - We present a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) dataset acquired during treadmill 
      walking in a brain-computer interface (BCI) task. The data were collected from 
      eight healthy subjects, each having three identical trials. Each trial consisted 
      of three conditions: standing, treadmill walking, and treadmill walking with a 
      closed-loop BCI. During the BCI condition, subjects used their brain activity to 
      control a virtual avatar on a screen to walk in real-time. Robust procedures were 
      designed to record lower limb joint angles (bilateral hip, knee, and ankle) using 
      goniometers synchronized with 60-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG). 
      Additionally, electrooculogram (EOG), EEG electrodes impedance, and digitized EEG 
      channel locations were acquired to aid artifact removal and EEG dipole-source 
      localization. This dataset is unique in that it is the first published MoBI 
      dataset recorded during walking. It is useful in addressing several important 
      open research questions, such as how EEG is coupled with gait cycle during 
      closed-loop BCI, how BCI influences neural activity during walking, and how a BCI 
      decoder may be optimized.

TI  - Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on 
      Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion.
LID - 10.3390/s18041073 [doi]
LID - 1073
AB  - More neuroscience researchers are using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to 
      measure electrocortical dynamics during human locomotion and other types of 
      movement. Motion artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of 
      interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often attributed to electrode 
      motion relative to the skin, but few studies have examined EEG signals under head 
      motion. In the current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the 
      overall mass and surface area of commercially available electrodes, as well as 
      how cable sway contributes to motion artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, 
      we used a gelatin head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical 
      signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode system. A 
      robotic platform moved the phantom head through sinusoidal displacements at 
      different frequencies (0-2 Hz). Results showed that a larger electrode surface 
      area can have a small but significant effect on improving EEG signal quality 
      during motion and that cable sway is a major contributor to motion artifacts. 
      These results have implications in the development of future hardware for mobile 
      brain imaging with EEG.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) has become increasingly valuable outside of its 
      traditional use in neurology. EEG is now used for neuropsychiatric diagnosis, 
      neurological evaluation of traumatic brain injury, neurotherapy, gaming, 
      neurofeedback, mindfulness, and cognitive enhancement training. The trend to 
      increase the number of EEG electrodes, the development of novel analytical 
      methods, and the availability of large data sets has created a data analysis 
      challenge to find the "signal of interest" that conveys the most information 
      about ongoing cognitive effort. Accordingly, we compare three common types of 
      neural synchrony measures that are applied to EEG-power analysis, phase locking, 
      and phase-amplitude coupling to assess which analytical measure provides the best 
      separation between EEG signals that were recorded, while healthy subjects 
      performed eight cognitive tasks-Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and its delayed 
      version, Stroop Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, Controlled Oral Word 
      Association Test, Trail Marking Test, Digit Span Test, and Benton Visual 
      Retention Test. We find that of the three analytical methods, phase-amplitude 
      coupling, specifically theta (4-7 Hz)-high gamma (70-90 Hz) obtained from frontal 
      and parietal EEG electrodes provides both the largest separation between the EEG 
      during cognitive tasks and also the highest classification accuracy between pairs 
      of tasks. We also find that phase-locking analysis provides the most distinct 
      clustering of tasks based on their utilization of long-term memory. Finally, we 
      show that phase-amplitude coupling is the least sensitive to contamination by 
      intense jaw-clenching muscle artifact.

TI  - ARTIST: A fully automated artifact rejection algorithm for single-pulse TMS-EEG 
      data.
PG  - 1607-1625
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23938 [doi]
AB  - Concurrent single-pulse TMS-EEG (spTMS-EEG) is an emerging noninvasive tool for 
      probing causal brain dynamics in humans. However, in addition to the common 
      artifacts in standard EEG data, spTMS-EEG data suffer from enormous 
      stimulation-induced artifacts, posing significant challenges to the extraction of 
      neural information. Typically, neural signals are analyzed after a manual 
      time-intensive and often subjective process of artifact rejection. Here we 
      describe a fully automated algorithm for spTMS-EEG artifact rejection. A key step 
      of this algorithm is to decompose the spTMS-EEG data into statistically 
      independent components (ICs), and then train a pattern classifier to 
      automatically identify artifact components based on knowledge of the 
      spatio-temporal profile of both neural and artefactual activities. The 
      autocleaned and hand-cleaned data yield qualitatively similar group evoked 
      potential waveforms. The algorithm achieves a 95% IC classification accuracy 
      referenced to expert artifact rejection performance, and does so across a large 
      number of spTMS-EEG data sets (n = 90 stimulation sites), retains high accuracy 
      across stimulation sites/subjects/populations/montages, and outperforms current 
      automated algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm was superior to the artifact 
      rejection performance of relatively novice individuals, who would be the likely 
      users of spTMS-EEG as the technique becomes more broadly disseminated. In 
      summary, our algorithm provides an automated, fast, objective, and accurate 
      method for cleaning spTMS-EEG data, which can increase the utility of TMS-EEG in 
      both clinical and basic neuroscience settings.

AB  - Data contamination due to physiological artifacts such as those generated by 
      eyeblinks, eye movements, and muscle activity continues to be a central concern 
      in the acquisition and analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. This issue 
      is further compounded in EEG sports science applications where the presence of 
      artifacts is notoriously difficult to control because behaviors that generate 
      these interferences are often the behaviors under investigation. Therefore, there 
      is a need to develop effective and efficient methods to identify physiological 
      artifacts in EEG recordings during sports applications so that they can be 
      isolated from cerebral activity related to the activities of interest. We have 
      developed an EEG artifact detection model, the Fingerprint Method, which 
      identifies different spatial, temporal, spectral, and statistical features 
      indicative of physiological artifacts and uses these features to automatically 
      classify artifactual independent components in EEG based on a machine leaning 
      approach. Here, we optimized our method using artifact-rich training data and a 
      procedure to determine which features were best suited to identify eyeblinks, eye 
      movements, and muscle artifacts. We then applied our model to an experimental 
      dataset collected during endurance cycling. Results reveal that unique sets of 
      features are suitable for the detection of distinct types of artifacts and that 
      the Optimized Fingerprint Method was able to correctly identify over 90% of the 
      artifactual components with physiological origin present in the experimental 
      data. These results represent a significant advancement in the search for 
      effective means to address artifact contamination in EEG sports science 
      applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We analyze the dynamics of rodent EEG amplitude in an experiment 
      accompanied by video recordings. Brain activity of animals is commonly acquired 
      together with a video of behavior, but recordings are rarely combined in 
      analysis. The data acquired is most commonly analyzed separately. To our 
      knowledge, no study has used behavior to improve the analysis of EEG waveforms, 
      specifically for artifact removal - other than through manual editing. COMPARISON 
      WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We explore two approaches: a traditional approach that 
      relies on data preprocessing and artifact rejection by an expert; and an 
      alternative approach that combines analysis of EEG with behavior extracted from 
      video recordings. NEW METHOD: We use the level of activity extracted from the 
      behavioral video as a measure of confidence in the acquired EEG waveform, and as 
      a weighting factor in averaging and statistical comparisons. RESULTS: We find in 
      analysis of the EEG that the two approaches lead to similar conclusions, but the 
      analysis leveraging behavioral data achieves this while avoiding many subjective 
      choices often required for artifact rejection and data preprocessing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The methods we describe allow for the inclusion of all recorded data 
      in the analysis, thereby making statistical tests more friendly to 
      interpretation, and making the data processing transparent and reproducible.

AB  - Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not routinely and 
      reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of responses such as 
      hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and 
      event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods-microelectrode 
      recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG)-have recently measured broadband power 
      elevation in field potentials (~50-200 Hz) as a proxy for locally averaged spike 
      rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband 
      responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Extracranial measurements like MEG 
      and EEG have multiple global noise sources and relatively low signal-to-noise 
      ratios; moreover high frequency artifacts from eye movements can be confounded 
      with stimulus design and mistaken for signals originating from brain activity. 
      For these reasons, we developed an automated denoising technique that helps 
      reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing 
      patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were 
      separated into evoked (12-Hz amplitude) and broadband components (60-150 Hz). In 
      all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over 
      occipital cortex, even in trials without microsaccades. The broadband pattern was 
      stimulus-dependent, with greater power contralateral to the stimulus. Because we 
      obtain reliable broadband estimates with short experiments (~20 minutes), and 
      with sufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we 
      conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, 
      non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for 
      addressing scientific questions about human brain function.

AB  - Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct communication channel by using 
      brain signals, enabling patients with motor impairments to interact with external 
      devices. Motion intention detection is useful for intuitive movement-based BCI as 
      movement is the fundamental mode of interaction with the environment. The aim of 
      this paper is to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain processes using 
      electroencephalography (EEG) to explore novel neural correlates of motion 
      intention. We investigate the changes in temporal dependencies of the EEG by 
      characterising the decay of autocorrelation during asynchronous voluntary finger 
      tapping movement. The evolution of the autocorrelation function is characterised 
      by its relaxation time, which is used as a robust marker for motion intention. We 
      observed that there was reorganisation of temporal dependencies in EEG during 
      motion intention. The autocorrelation decayed slower during movement intention 
      and faster during the resting state. There was an increase in temporal dependence 
      during movement intention. The relaxation time of the autocorrelation function 
      showed significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between movement and resting state 
      with the mean sensitivity of 78.37 ± 8.83%. The relaxation time provides movement 
      related information that is complementary to the well-known event-related 
      desynchronisation (ERD) by characterising the broad band EEG dynamics which is 
      frequency independent in contrast to ERD. It can also detect motion intention on 
      average 0.51s before the actual movement onset. We have thoroughly compared 
      autocorrelation relaxation time features with ERD in four frequency bands. The 
      relaxation time may therefore, complement the well-known features used in 
      motion-based BCI leading to more robust and intuitive BCI solutions. The results 
      obtained suggest that changes in autocorrelation decay may involve reorganisation 
      of temporal dependencies of brain activity over longer duration during motion 
      intention. This opens the possibilities of investigating further the temporal 
      dynamics of fundamental neural processes underpinning motion intention.

TI  - Removal of muscular artifacts in EEG signals: a comparison of linear 
      decomposition methods.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.1007/s40708-017-0074-6 [doi]
AB  - The most common approach to reduce muscle artifacts in electroencephalographic 
      signals is to linearly decompose the signals in order to separate artifactual 
      from neural sources, using one of several variants of independent component 
      analysis (ICA). Here we compare three of the most commonly used ICA methods 
      (extended Infomax, FastICA and TDSEP) with two other linear decomposition methods 
      (Fourier-ICA and spatio-spectral decomposition) suitable for the extraction of 
      oscillatory activity. We evaluate the methods' ability to remove event-locked 
      muscle artifacts while maintaining event-related desynchronization in data from 
      18 subjects who performed self-paced foot movements. We find that all five 
      analyzed methods drastically reduce the muscle artifacts. For the three ICA 
      methods, adequately high-pass filtering is very important. Compared to the effect 
      of high-pass filtering, differences between the five analyzed methods were small, 
      with extended Infomax performing best.

TI  - The Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for Electroencephalography (HAPPE): 
      Standardized Processing Software for Developmental and High-Artifact Data.

AB  - Electroenchephalography (EEG) recordings collected with developmental populations 
      present particular challenges from a data processing perspective. These EEGs have 
      a high degree of artifact contamination and often short recording lengths. As 
      both sample sizes and EEG channel densities increase, traditional processing 
      approaches like manual data rejection are becoming unsustainable. Moreover, such 
      subjective approaches preclude standardized metrics of data quality, despite the 
      heightened importance of such measures for EEGs with high rates of initial 
      artifact contamination. There is presently a paucity of automated resources for 
      processing these EEG data and no consistent reporting of data quality measures. 
      To address these challenges, we propose the Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline 
      for EEG (HAPPE) as a standardized, automated pipeline compatible with EEG 
      recordings of variable lengths and artifact contamination levels, including 
      high-artifact and short EEG recordings from young children or those with 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. HAPPE processes event-related and resting-state EEG 
      data from raw files through a series of filtering, artifact rejection, and 
      re-referencing steps to processed EEG suitable for time-frequency-domain 
      analyses. HAPPE also includes a post-processing report of data quality metrics to 
      facilitate the evaluation and reporting of data quality in a standardized manner. 
      Here, we describe each processing step in HAPPE, perform an example analysis with 
      EEG files we have made freely available, and show that HAPPE outperforms seven 
      alternative, widely-used processing approaches. HAPPE removes more artifact than 
      all alternative approaches while simultaneously preserving greater or equivalent 
      amounts of EEG signal in almost all instances. We also provide distributions of 
      HAPPE's data quality metrics in an 867 file dataset as a reference distribution 
      and in support of HAPPE's performance across EEG data with variable artifact 
      contamination and recording lengths. HAPPE software is freely available under the 
      terms of the GNU General Public License at https://github.com/lcnhappe/happe.

AB  - Assessment of the cortical role during bipedalism has been a methodological 
      challenge. While surface electroencephalography (EEG) is capable of 
      non-invasively measuring cortical activity during human locomotion, it is 
      associated with movement artifacts obscuring cerebral sources of activity. 
      Recently, statistical methods based on blind source separation revealed potential 
      for resolving this issue, by segregating non-cerebral/artifactual from cerebral 
      sources of activity. This step marked a new opportunity for the investigation of 
      the brains' role while moving and was tagged mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI). 
      This methodology involves simultaneous mobile recording of brain activity with 
      several other body behavioral variables (e.g., muscle activity and kinematics), 
      through wireless recording wearable devices/sensors. Notably, several MoBI 
      studies using EEG-EMG approaches recently showed that the brain is functionally 
      connected to the muscles and active throughout the whole gait cycle and, thus, 
      rejecting the long-lasting idea of a solely spinal-driven bipedalism. However, 
      MoBI and brain/muscle connectivity assessments during human locomotion are still 
      in their fledgling state of investigation. Mobile brain/body imaging approaches 
      hint toward promising opportunities; however, there are some remaining pitfalls 
      that need to be resolved before considering their routine clinical use. This 
      article discusses several of these pitfalls and proposes research to address 
      them. Examples relate to the validity, reliability, and reproducibility of this 
      method in ecologically valid scenarios and in different populations. Furthermore, 
      whether brain/muscle connectivity within the MoBI framework represents a 
      potential biomarker in neuromuscular syndromes where gait disturbances are 
      evident (e.g., age-related sarcopenia) remains to be determined.

TI  - A new ICA-based fingerprint method for the automatic removal of physiological 
      artifacts from EEG recordings.
PG  - e4380
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4380 [doi]
LID - e4380
AB  - BACKGROUND: EEG may be affected by artefacts hindering the analysis of brain 
      signals. Data-driven methods like independent component analysis (ICA) are 
      successful approaches to remove artefacts from the EEG. However, the ICA-based 
      methods developed so far are often affected by limitations, such as: the need for 
      visual inspection of the separated independent components (subjectivity problem) 
      and, in some cases, for the independent and simultaneous recording of the 
      inspected artefacts to identify the artefactual independent components; a 
      potentially heavy manipulation of the EEG signals; the use of linear 
      classification methods; the use of simulated artefacts to validate the methods; 
      no testing in dry electrode or high-density EEG datasets; applications limited to 
      specific conditions and electrode layouts. METHODS: Our fingerprint method 
      automatically identifies EEG ICs containing eyeblinks, eye movements, myogenic 
      artefacts and cardiac interference by evaluating 14 temporal, spatial, spectral, 
      and statistical features composing the IC fingerprint. Sixty-two real EEG 
      datasets containing cued artefacts are recorded with wet and dry electrodes (128 
      wet and 97 dry channels). For each artefact, 10 nonlinear SVM classifiers are 
      trained on fingerprints of expert-classified ICs. Training groups include 
      randomly chosen wet and dry datasets decomposed in 80 ICs. The classifiers are 
      tested on the IC-fingerprints of different datasets decomposed into 20, 50, or 80 
      ICs. The SVM performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, False Omission Rate 
      (FOR), Hit Rate (HR), False Alarm Rate (FAR), and sensitivity (p). For each 
      artefact, the quality of the artefact-free EEG reconstructed using the 
      classification of the best SVM is assessed by visual inspection and SNR. RESULTS: 
      The best SVM classifier for each artefact type achieved average accuracy of 1 
      (eyeblink), 0.98 (cardiac interference), and 0.97 (eye movement and myogenic 
      artefact). Average classification sensitivity (p) was 1 (eyeblink), 0.997 
      (myogenic artefact), 0.98 (eye movement), and 0.48 (cardiac interference). 
      Average artefact reduction ranged from a maximum of 82% for eyeblinks to a 
      minimum of 33% for cardiac interference, depending on the effectiveness of the 
      proposed method and the amplitude of the removed artefact. The performance of the 
      SVM classifiers did not depend on the electrode type, whereas it was better for 
      lower decomposition levels (50 and 20 ICs). DISCUSSION: Apart from cardiac 
      interference, SVM performance and average artefact reduction indicate that the 
      fingerprint method has an excellent overall performance in the automatic 
      detection of eyeblinks, eye movements and myogenic artefacts, which is comparable 
      to that of existing methods. Being also independent from simultaneous artefact 
      recording, electrode number, type and layout, and decomposition level, the 
      proposed fingerprint method can have useful applications in clinical and 
      experimental EEG settings.

AB  - Combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) plays a potential role in neuroimaging due to its high 
      spatial and temporal resolution. However, EEG is easily influenced by 
      ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts and may cause false identification of the 
      related EEG features, such as epileptic spikes. There are many related methods to 
      remove them, however, they do not consider the time-varying features of BCG 
      artifacts. In this paper, a novel method using clustering algorithm to catch the 
      BCG artifacts' features and together with the constrained ICA (ccICA) is proposed 
      to remove the BCG artifacts. We first applied this method to the simulated data, 
      which was constructed by adding the BCG artifacts to the EEG signal obtained from 
      the conventional environment. Then, our method was tested to demonstrate the 
      effectiveness during EEG and fMRI experiments on 10 healthy subjects. In 
      simulated data analysis, the value of error in signal amplitude (Er) computed by 
      ccICA method was lower than those from other methods including AAS, OBS, and cICA 
      (p < 0.005). In vivo data analysis, the Improvement of Normalized Power Spectrum 
      (INPS) calculated by ccICA method in all electrodes was much higher than AAS, 
      OBS, and cICA methods (p < 0.005). We also used other evaluation index (e.g., 
      power analysis) to compare our method with other traditional methods. In 
      conclusion, our novel method successfully and effectively removed BCG artifacts 
      in both simulated and vivo EEG data tests, showing the potentials of removing 
      artifacts in EEG-fMRI applications.

AB  - The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography (EEG) with functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a very promising non-invasive technique for 
      the study of human brain function. Despite continuous improvements, it remains a 
      challenging technique, and a standard methodology for data analysis is yet to be 
      established. Here we review the methodologies that are currently available to 
      address the challenges at each step of the data analysis pipeline. We start by 
      surveying methods for pre-processing both EEG and fMRI data. On the EEG side, we 
      focus on the correction for several MR-induced artifacts, particularly the 
      gradient and pulse artifacts, as well as other sources of EEG artifacts. On the 
      fMRI side, we consider image artifacts induced by the presence of EEG hardware 
      inside the MR scanner, and the contamination of the fMRI signal by physiological 
      noise of non-neuronal origin, including a review of several approaches to model 
      and remove it. We then provide an overview of the approaches specifically 
      employed for the integration of EEG and fMRI when using EEG to predict the blood 
      oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, the so-called EEG-informed fMRI 
      integration strategy, the most commonly used strategy in EEG-fMRI research. 
      Finally, we systematically review methods used for the extraction of EEG features 
      reflecting neuronal phenomena of interest.

TI  - Automated Detection of Postictal Generalized EEG Suppression.
PG  - 371-377
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2017.2771468 [doi]
AB  - Although there is no strict consensus, some studies have reported that Postictal 
      generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is a potential electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      biomarker for risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). PGES is an 
      epoch of EEG inactivity after a seizure, and the detection of PGES in clinical 
      data is extremely difficult due to artifacts from breathing, movement and muscle 
      activity that can adversely affect the quality of the recorded EEG data. Even 
      clinical experts visually interpreting the EEG will have diverse opinions on the 
      start and end of PGES for a given patient. The development of an automated EEG 
      suppression detection tool can assist clinical personnel in the review and 
      annotation of seizure files, and can also provide a standard for quantifying PGES 
      in large patient cohorts, possibly leading to further clarification of the role 
      of PGES as a biomarker of SUDEP risk. In this paper, we develop an automated 
      system that can detect the start and end of PGES using frequency domain features 
      in combination with boosting classification algorithms. The average power for 
      different frequency ranges of EEG signals are extracted from the prefiltered 
      recorded signal using the fast fourier transform and are used as the feature set 
      for the classification algorithm. The underlying classifiers for the boosting 
      algorithm are linear classifiers using a logistic regression model. The tool is 
      developed using 12 seizures annotated by an expert then tested and evaluated on 
      another 20 seizures that were annotated by 11 experts.

TI  - Effects of signal artefacts on electroencephalography spectral power during 
      sleep: quantifying the effectiveness of automated artefact-rejection algorithms.
PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12576 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep are often contaminated by 
      muscle and ocular artefacts, which can affect the results of spectral power 
      analyses significantly. However, the extent to which these artefacts affect EEG 
      spectral power across different sleep states has not been quantified explicitly. 
      Consequently, the effectiveness of automated artefact-rejection algorithms in 
      minimizing these effects has not been characterized fully. To address these 
      issues, we analysed standard 10-channel EEG recordings from 20 subjects during 
      one night of sleep. We compared their spectral power when the recordings were 
      contaminated by artefacts and after we removed them by visual inspection or by 
      using automated artefact-rejection algorithms. During both rapid eye movement 
      (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, muscle artefacts contaminated no more than 5% of 
      the EEG data across all channels. However, they corrupted delta, beta and gamma 
      power levels substantially by up to 126, 171 and 938%, respectively, relative to 
      the power level computed from artefact-free data. Although ocular artefacts were 
      infrequent during NREM sleep, they affected up to 16% of the frontal and temporal 
      EEG channels during REM sleep, primarily corrupting delta power by up to 33%. For 
      both REM and NREM sleep, the automated artefact-rejection algorithms matched 
      power levels to within ~10% of the artefact-free power level for each EEG channel 
      and frequency band. In summary, although muscle and ocular artefacts affect only 
      a small fraction of EEG data, they affect EEG spectral power significantly. This 
      suggests the importance of using artefact-rejection algorithms before analysing 
      EEG data.

LID - 5081258
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are usually contaminated with various 
      artifacts, such as signal associated with muscle activity, eye movement, and body 
      motion, which have a noncerebral origin. The amplitude of such artifacts is 
      larger than that of the electrical activity of the brain, so they mask the 
      cortical signals of interest, resulting in biased analysis and interpretation. 
      Several blind source separation methods have been developed to remove artifacts 
      from the EEG recordings. However, the iterative process for measuring separation 
      within multichannel recordings is computationally intractable. Moreover, manually 
      excluding the artifact components requires a time-consuming offline process. This 
      work proposes a real-time artifact removal algorithm that is based on canonical 
      correlation analysis (CCA), feature extraction, and the Gaussian mixture model 
      (GMM) to improve the quality of EEG signals. The CCA was used to decompose EEG 
      signals into components followed by feature extraction to extract representative 
      features and GMM to cluster these features into groups to recognize and remove 
      artifacts. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by 
      effectively removing artifacts caused by blinks, head/body movement, and chewing 
      from EEG recordings while preserving the temporal and spectral characteristics of 
      the signals that are important to cognitive research.

TI  - Automated Multiclass Classification of Spontaneous EEG Activity in Alzheimer's 
      Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.

LID - 35
AB  - The discrimination of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal form 
      (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) from cognitively healthy control (HC) 
      subjects is crucial since the treatment is more effective in the first stages of 
      the dementia. The aim of our study is to evaluate the usefulness of a methodology 
      based on electroencephalography (EEG) to detect AD and MCI. EEG rhythms were 
      recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects and 37 HC subjects. Artifact-free 
      trials were analyzed by means of several spectral and nonlinear features: 
      relative power in the conventional frequency bands, median frequency, individual 
      alpha frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central tendency 
      measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information. Relevance 
      and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast correlation-based 
      filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The selected features were used 
      to train three different models aimed at classifying the trials: linear 
      discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and 
      multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP). Afterwards, each subject 
      was automatically allocated in a particular group by applying a trial-based 
      majority vote procedure. After feature extraction, the FCBF method selected the 
      optimal set of features: individual alpha frequency, relative power at delta 
      frequency band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of features, MLP 
      showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a subject is not 
      healthy (sensitivity of 82.35% and positive predictive value of 84.85% for HC vs. 
      all classification task) and whether a subject does not suffer from AD 
      (specificity of 79.41% and negative predictive value of 84.38% for AD vs. all 
      comparison). Our findings suggest that our methodology can help physicians to 
      discriminate AD, MCI and HC.

AB  - The electroencephalogram (EEG) constitutes a relevant tool to study neural 
      dynamics and to develop brain-machine interfaces (BMI) for rehabilitation of 
      patients with paralysis due to stroke. However, the EEG is easily contaminated by 
      artifacts of physiological origin, which can pollute the measured cortical 
      activity and bias the interpretations of such data. This is especially relevant 
      when recording EEG of stroke patients while they try to move their paretic limbs, 
      since they generate more artifacts due to compensatory activity. In this paper, 
      we study how physiological artifacts (i.e., eye movements, motion artifacts, 
      muscle artifacts and compensatory movements with the other limb) can affect EEG 
      activity of stroke patients. Data from 31 severely paralyzed stroke patients 
      performing/attempting grasping movements with their healthy/paralyzed hand were 
      analyzed offline. We estimated the cortical activation as the event-related 
      desynchronization (ERD) of sensorimotor rhythms and used it to detect the 
      movements with a pseudo-online simulated BMI. Automated state-of-the-art methods 
      (linear regression to remove ocular contaminations and statistical thresholding 
      to reject the other types of artifacts) were used to minimize the influence of 
      artifacts. The effect of artifact reduction was quantified in terms of ERD and 
      BMI performance. The results reveal a significant contamination affecting the 
      EEG, being involuntary muscle activity the main source of artifacts. Artifact 
      reduction helped extracting the oscillatory signatures of motor tasks, isolating 
      relevant information from noise and revealing a more prominent ERD activity. 
      Lower BMI performances were obtained when artifacts were eliminated from the 
      training datasets. This suggests that artifacts produce an optimistic bias that 
      improves theoretical accuracy but may result in a poor link between task-related 
      oscillatory activity and BMI peripheral feedback. With a clinically relevant 
      dataset of stroke patients, we evidence the need of appropriate methodologies to 
      remove artifacts from EEG datasets to obtain accurate estimations of the motor 
      brain activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical and electrographic features of seizures in anti-LGI1 
      encephalitis are distinct from those seen in other autoimmune encephalitides or 
      non-encephalitic epilepsies. One electroclinical phenomenon specific to the 
      condition consists of lateralized motor spasms, known as faciobrachial dystonic 
      seizures (FBDS). An electrodecremental pattern overriding a "DC shift" has been 
      described as the EEG correlate of these spasms. We sought to further characterize 
      this pre-spasm infraslow activity (ISA). METHODS: Continuous video-EEG recordings 
      were acquired in four patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis: each had frequent 
      motor spasms/FBDS as well as frequent subclinical temporal lobe seizures (an 
      independent indicator of anti-LGI1 encephalitis). RESULTS: In artifact-free 
      recordings obtained using clinical amplifiers equipped with a low frequency 
      analog filter of 0.07 Hz, ISA reliably preceded clinical onset of the motor 
      spasms by ∼1.2 s and preceded the electrodecremental pattern by ∼700 ms. 
      Pre-spasm ISA was invariably recorded contralateral to FBDS, with a voltage 
      topographic maximum over the mid frontal region. The pre-movement ISA differed 
      from the Bereitschaftspotential in timing and topography and was an order of 
      magnitude higher in amplitude. Sporadic FBDS that occurred in association with 
      temporal lobe seizures were preceded by identical ISA. CONCLUSIONS: The motor 
      spasms of anti-LGI1 encephalitis are preceded by frontal ISA. A paucity of data 
      at the microscale level precludes mechanistic explanations at the macroscale 
      level, or even determination of the relative contributions of neurons and glia in 
      the generation of the ISA. SIGNIFICANCE: Although fundamental cellular mechanisms 
      await elucidation, the pre-spasm ISA represents a singular and readily 
      identifiable EEG response to this autoimmune brain disorder.

TI  - Online Reduction of Artifacts in EEG of Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Using Reference 
      Layer Adaptive Filtering (RLAF).
PG  - 129-149
LID - 10.1007/s10548-017-0606-7 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) allow us to study the active human brain from two perspectives 
      concurrently. Signal processing based artifact reduction techniques are mandatory 
      for this, however, to obtain reasonable EEG quality in simultaneous EEG-fMRI. 
      Current artifact reduction techniques like average artifact subtraction (AAS), 
      typically become less effective when artifact reduction has to be performed 
      on-the-fly. We thus present and evaluate a new technique to improve EEG quality 
      online. This technique adds up with online AAS and combines a prototype EEG-cap 
      for reference recordings of artifacts, with online adaptive filtering and is 
      named reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF). We found online AAS + RLAF to be 
      highly effective in improving EEG quality. Online AAS + RLAF outperformed online 
      AAS and did so in particular online in terms of the chosen performance metrics, 
      these being specifically alpha rhythm amplitude ratio between closed and opened 
      eyes (3-45% improvement), signal-to-noise-ratio of visual evoked potentials (VEP) 
      (25-63% improvement), and VEPs variability (16-44% improvement). Further, we 
      found that EEG quality after online AAS + RLAF is occasionally even comparable 
      with the offline variant of AAS at a 3T MRI scanner. In conclusion RLAF is a very 
      effective add-on tool to enable high quality EEG in simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      experiments, even when online artifact reduction is necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a detector that identifies ripple (80-200 Hz) 
      events in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in a referential montage and 
      utilizes independent component analysis (ICA) to eliminate or reduce 
      high-frequency artifact contamination. Also, investigate the correspondence of 
      detected ripples and the seizure onset zone (SOZ). METHODS: iEEG recordings from 
      16 patients were first band-pass filtered (80-600 Hz) and Infomax ICA was next 
      applied to derive the first independent component (IC1). IC1 was subsequently 
      pruned, and an artifact index was derived to reduce the identification of 
      high-frequency events introduced by the reference electrode signal. A Hilbert 
      detector identified ripple events in the processed iEEG recordings using 
      amplitude and duration criteria. The identified ripple events were further 
      classified and characterized as true or false ripple on spikes, or ripples on 
      oscillations by utilizing a topographical analysis to their time-frequency plot, 
      and confirmed by visual inspection. RESULTS: The signal to noise ratio was 
      improved by pruning IC1. The precision of the detector for ripple events was 
      91.27 ± 4.3%, and the sensitivity of the detector was 79.4 ± 3.0% (N = 16 
      patients, 5842 ripple events). The sensitivity and precision of the detector was 
      equivalent in iEEG recordings obtained during sleep or intra-operatively. Across 
      all the patients, true ripple on spike rates and also the rates of false ripple 
      on spikes, that were generated due to filter ringing, classified the seizure 
      onset zone (SOZ) with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of >76%. 
      The magnitude and spectral content of true ripple on spikes generated in the SOZ 
      was distinct as compared with the ripples generated in the NSOZ (p < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing ICA to analyze iEEG recordings in referential montage 
      provides many benefits to the study of high-frequency oscillations. The ripple 
      rates and properties defined using this approach may accurately delineate the 
      seizure onset zone. SIGNIFICANCE: Strategies to improve the spatial resolution of 
      intracranial EEG and reduce artifact can help improve the clinical utility of HFO

AB  - Continuous brain imaging techniques can be beneficial for the monitoring of 
      neurological pathologies (such as epilepsy or stroke) and neuroimaging protocols 
      involving movement. Among existing ones, functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have the advantage of being noninvasive, 
      nonobstructive, inexpensive, yield portable solutions, and offer complementary 
      monitoring of electrical and local hemodynamic activities. This article presents 
      a novel system with 128 fNIRS channels and 32 EEG channels with the potential to 
      cover a larger fraction of the adult superficial cortex than earlier works, is 
      integrated with 32 EEG channels, is light and battery-powered to improve 
      portability, and can transmit data wirelessly to an interface for real-time 
      display of electrical and hemodynamic activities. A novel fNIRS-EEG stretchable 
      cap, two analog channels for auxiliary data (e.g., electrocardiogram), eight 
      digital triggers for event-related protocols and an internal accelerometer for 
      movement artifacts removal contribute to improve data acquisition quality. The 
      system can run continuously for 24 h. Following instrumentation validation and 
      reliability on a solid phantom, performance was evaluated on (1) 12 healthy 
      participants during either a visual (checkerboard) task at rest or while 
      pedalling on a stationary bicycle or a cognitive (language) task and (2) 4 
      patients admitted either to the epilepsy (n = 3) or stroke (n = 1) units. Data 
      analysis confirmed expected hemodynamic variations during validation recordings 
      and useful clinical information during in-hospital testing. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a wearable wireless multichannel 
      fNIRS-EEG monitoring system in patients with neurological conditions. Hum Brain

TI  - Reduction of (18)F-FDG Dose in Clinical PET/MR Imaging by Using Silicon 
      Photomultiplier Detectors.
PG  - 249-259
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2017162305 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To determine the level of clinically acceptable reduction in injected 
      fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) dose in time-of-flight 
      (TOF)-positron emission tomography(PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging by using 
      silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors compared with TOF-PET/computed 
      tomography (CT) using Lu1.8Y0.2SiO(5)(Ce), or LYSO, detectors in patients with 
      different body mass indexes (BMIs). Materials and Methods Patients were enrolled 
      in this study as part of a larger prospective study with a different purpose than 
      evaluated in this study (NCT02316431). All patients gave written informed consent 
      prior to inclusion into the study. In this study, 74 patients with different 
      malignant diseases underwent sequential whole-body TOF-PET/CT and TOF-PET/MR 
      imaging. PET images with simulated reduction of injected (18)F-FDG doses were 
      generated by unlisting the list-mode data from PET/MR imaging. Two readers rated 
      the image quality of whole-body data sets, as well as the image quality in each 
      body compartment, and evaluated the conspicuity of malignant lesions. Results The 
      image quality with 70% or 60% of the injected dose of (18)F-FDG at PET/MR imaging 
      was comparable to that at PET/CT. With 50% of the injected dose, comparable image 
      quality was maintained among patients with a BMI of less than 25 kg/m(2). PET 
      images without TOF reconstruction showed higher artifact scores and deteriorated 
      sharpness than those with TOF reconstruction. Conclusion Sixty percent of the 
      usually injected (18)F-FDG dose (reduction of up to 40%) in patients with a BMI 
      of more than 25 kg/m(2) results in clinically adequate PET image quality in 
      TOF-PET/MR imaging performed by using SiPM detectors. Additionally, in patients 
      with a BMI of less than 25 kg/m(2), 50% of the injected dose may safely be used.

TI  - The CS algorithm: A novel method for high frequency oscillation detection in EEG.
PG  - 6-16
LID - S0165-0270(17)30304-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.08.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are emerging as potentially 
      clinically important biomarkers for localizing seizure generating regions in 
      epileptic brain. These events, however, are too frequent, and occur on too small 
      a time scale to be identified quickly or reliably by human reviewers. Many of the 
      deficiencies of the HFO detection algorithms published to date are addressed by 
      the CS algorithm presented here. NEW METHOD: The algorithm employs novel methods 
      for: 1) normalization; 2) storage of parameters to model human expertise; 3) 
      differentiating highly localized oscillations from filtering phenomena; and 4) 
      defining temporal extents of detected events. RESULTS: Receiver-operator 
      characteristic curves demonstrate very low false positive rates with 
      concomitantly high true positive rates over a large range of detector thresholds. 
      The temporal resolution is shown to be +/-∼5ms for event boundaries. 
      Computational efficiency is sufficient for use in a clinical setting. COMPARISON 
      WITH EXISTING METHODS: The algorithm performance is directly compared to two 
      established algorithms by Staba (2002) and Gardner (2007). Comparison with all 
      published algorithms is beyond the scope of this work, but the features of all 
      are discussed. All code and example data sets are freely available. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The algorithm is shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for HFOs, be 
      robust to common forms of artifact in EEG, and have performance adequate for use 
      in a clinical setting.

TI  - Comparison between Scalp EEG and Behind-the-Ear EEG for Development of a Wearable 
      Seizure Detection System for Patients with Focal Epilepsy.
LID - 10.3390/s18010029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - A wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) device for continuous monitoring of 
      patients suffering from epilepsy would provide valuable information for the 
      management of the disease. Currently no EEG setup is small and unobtrusive enough 
      to be used in daily life. Recording behind the ear could prove to be a solution 
      to a wearable EEG setup. This article examines the feasibility of recording 
      epileptic EEG from behind the ear. It is achieved by comparison with scalp EEG 
      recordings. Traditional scalp EEG and behind-the-ear EEG were simultaneously 
      acquired from 12 patients with temporal, parietal, or occipital lobe epilepsy. 
      Behind-the-ear EEG consisted of cross-head channels and unilateral channels. The 
      analysis on Electrooculography (EOG) artifacts resulting from eye blinking showed 
      that EOG artifacts were absent on cross-head channels and had significantly small 
      amplitudes on unilateral channels. Temporal waveform and frequency content during 
      seizures from behind-the-ear EEG visually resembled that from scalp EEG. Further, 
      coherence analysis confirmed that behind-the-ear EEG acquired meaningful 
      epileptic discharges similarly to scalp EEG. Moreover, automatic seizure 
      detection based on support vector machine (SVM) showed that comparable seizure 
      detection performance can be achieved using these two recordings. With scalp EEG, 
      detection had a median sensitivity of 100% and a false detection rate of 1.14 per 
      hour, while, with behind-the-ear EEG, it had a median sensitivity of 94.5% and a 
      false detection rate of 0.52 per hour. These findings demonstrate the feasibility 
      of detecting seizures from EEG recordings behind the ear for patients with focal 
      epilepsy.

TI  - Forced Use of the Paretic Leg Induced by a Constraint Force Applied to the 
      Nonparetic Leg in Individuals Poststroke During Walking.
PG  - 1042-1052
LID - 10.1177/1545968317740972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with stroke usually show reduced muscle activities of the 
      paretic leg and asymmetrical gait pattern during walking. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether applying a resistance force to the nonparetic leg would enhance the 
      muscle activities of the paretic leg and improve the symmetry of spatiotemporal 
      gait parameters in individuals with poststroke hemiparesis. METHODS: Fifteen 
      individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis participated in this study. A 
      controlled resistance force was applied to the nonparetic leg using a customized 
      cable-driven robotic system while subjects walked on a treadmill. Subjects 
      completed 2 test sections with the resistance force applied at different phases 
      of gait (ie, early and late swing phases) and different magnitudes (10%, 20%, and 
      30% of maximum voluntary contraction [MVC] of nonparetic leg hip flexors). 
      Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the muscles of the paretic leg and 
      spatiotemporal gait parameters were collected. RESULTS: Significant increases in 
      integrated EMG of medial gastrocnemius, medial hamstrings, vastus medialis, and 
      tibialis anterior of the paretic leg were observed when the resistance was 
      applied during the early swing phase of the nonparetic leg, compared with 
      baseline. Additionally, resistance with 30% of MVC induced the greatest level of 
      muscle activity than that with 10% or 20% of MVC. The symmetry index of gait 
      parameters also improved with resistance applied during the early swing phase. 
      CONCLUSION: Applying a controlled resistance force to the nonparetic leg during 
      early swing phase may induce forced use on the paretic leg and improve the 
      spatiotemporal symmetry of gait in individuals with poststroke hemiparesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Classify rhythmic EEG patterns in extremely preterm infants and relate 
      these to brain injury and outcome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 77 infants 
      born <28 weeks gestational age (GA) who had a 2-channel EEG during the first 72 h 
      after birth. Patterns detected by the BrainZ seizure detection algorithm were 
      categorized: ictal discharges, periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) and other 
      waveforms. Brain injury was assessed with sequential cranial ultrasound (cUS) and 
      MRI at term-equivalent age. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed with the 
      BSITD-III (2 years) and WPPSI-III-NL (5 years). RESULTS: Rhythmic patterns were 
      observed in 62.3% (ictal 1.3%, PEDs 44%, other waveforms 86.3%) with multiple 
      patterns in 36.4%. Ictal discharges were only observed in one and excluded from 
      further analyses. The EEG location of the other waveforms (p<0.05), but not PEDs 
      (p=0.238), was significantly associated with head position. No relation was found 
      between the median total duration of each pattern and injury on cUS and MRI or 
      cognition at 2 and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Clear ictal discharges are rare in 
      extremely preterm infants. PEDs are common but their significance is unclear. 
      Rhythmic waveforms related to head position are likely artefacts. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Rhythmic EEG patterns may have a different significance in extremely preterm 
      infants.

TI  - Adaptive Spatial Filter Based on Similarity Indices to Preserve the Neural 
      Information on EEG Signals during On-Line Processing.
LID - 10.3390/s17122725 [doi]
LID - 2725
AB  - This work presents a new on-line adaptive filter, which is based on a similarity 
      analysis between standard electrode locations, in order to reduce artifacts and 
      common interferences throughout electroencephalography (EEG) signals, but 
      preserving the useful information. Standard deviation and Concordance Correlation 
      Coefficient (CCC) between target electrodes and its correspondent neighbor 
      electrodes are analyzed on sliding windows to select those neighbors that are 
      highly correlated. Afterwards, a model based on CCC is applied to provide higher 
      values of weight to those correlated electrodes with lower similarity to the 
      target electrode. The approach was applied to brain computer-interfaces (BCIs) 
      based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to recognize 40 targets of 
      steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), providing an accuracy (ACC) of 
      86.44 ± 2.81%. In addition, also using this approach, features of low frequency 
      were selected in the pre-processing stage of another BCI to recognize gait 
      planning. In this case, the recognition was significantly ( p < 0.01 ) improved 
      for most of the subjects ( A C C ≥ 74.79 % ) , when compared with other BCIs 
      based on Common Spatial Pattern, Filter Bank-Common Spatial Pattern, and 
      Riemannian Geometry.

AB  - Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in infants enables 
      important studies of functional brain organization early in human development. 
      However, rs-fMRI in infants has universally been obtained during sleep to reduce 
      participant motion artifact, raising the question of whether differences in 
      functional organization between awake adults and sleeping infants that are 
      commonly attributed to development may instead derive, at least in part, from 
      sleep. This question is especially important as rs-fMRI differences in adult wake 
      vs. sleep are well documented. To investigate this question, we compared 
      functional connectivity and BOLD signal propagation patterns in 6, 12, and 24 
      month old sleeping infants with patterns in adult wakefulness and non-REM sleep. 
      We find that important functional connectivity features seen during infant sleep 
      closely resemble those seen during adult sleep, including reduced default mode 
      network functional connectivity. However, we also find differences between infant 
      and adult sleep, especially in thalamic BOLD signal propagation patterns. These 
      findings highlight the importance of considering sleep state when drawing 
      developmental inferences in infant rs-fMRI.

TI  - Physiological Ripples (± 100 Hz) in Spike-Free Scalp EEGs of Children With and 
      Without Epilepsy.
PG  - 739-746
LID - 10.1007/s10548-017-0590-y [doi]
AB  - Pathological high frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80 Hz) are considered new 
      biomarkers for epilepsy. They have mostly been recorded invasively, but 
      pathological ripples (80-250 Hz) can also be found in scalp EEGs with frequent 
      epileptiform spikes. Physiological HFOs also exist. They have been recorded 
      invasively in hippocampus and neocortex. There are no reports of spontaneously 
      occurring physiological HFOs recorded with scalp EEG. We aimed to study ripples 
      in spike-free scalp EEGs. We included 23 children (6 with, 17 without epilepsy) 
      who had an EEG without interictal epileptiform spikes recorded during sleep. We 
      differentiated true ripples from spurious ripples such as filtering effects of 
      sharp artifacts and high frequency components of muscle artifacts by viewing 
      ripples simultaneously in bipolar and average montage and double-checking the 
      unfiltered signal. We calculated mean frequency, duration and root mean square 
      amplitude of the ripples, and studied their shape and distribution. We found 
      ripples in EEGs of 20 out of 23 children (4 with, 16 without epilepsy). Ripples 
      had a regular shape and occurred mostly on central and midline channels. Mean 
      frequency was 102 Hz, mean duration 70 ms, mean root mean square amplitude 
      0.95 µV. Ripples occurring in normal EEGs of children without epilepsy were 
      considered physiological; the similarity in appearance suggested that the ripples 
      occurring in normal EEGs of children with epilepsy were also physiological. The 
      finding that it is possible to study physiological neocortical ripples in scalp 
      EEG paves the way for investigating their occurrence during brain development and 
      their relation with cognitive functioning.

TI  - Postoperative seizure freedom does not normalize altered connectivity in temporal 
      lobe epilepsy.
PG  - 1842-1851
LID - 10.1111/epi.13867 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Specific changes in the functional connectivity of brain networks 
      occur in patients with epilepsy. Yet whether such changes reflect a stable 
      disease effect or one that is a function of active seizure burden remains 
      unclear. Here, we longitudinally assessed the connectivity of canonical cognitive 
      functional networks in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 
      both before and after patients underwent epilepsy surgery and achieved seizure 
      freedom. METHODS: Seventeen patients with intractable TLE who underwent epilepsy 
      surgery with Engel class I outcome and 17 matched healthy controls took part in 
      the study. The functional connectivity of a set of cognitive functional networks 
      derived from typical cognitive tasks was assessed in patients, preoperatively and 
      postoperatively, as well as in controls, using stringent methods of artifact 
      reduction. RESULTS: Preoperatively, functional networks in TLE patients differed 
      significantly from healthy controls, with differences that largely, but not 
      exclusively, involved the default mode and temporal/auditory subnetworks. 
      However, undergoing epilepsy surgery and achieving seizure freedom did not lead 
      to significant changes in network connectivity, with postoperative functional 
      network abnormalities closely mirroring the preoperative state. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      This result argues for a stable chronic effect of the disease on brain 
      connectivity, with changes that are largely "burned in" by the time a patient 
      with intractable TLE undergoes epilepsy surgery, which typically occurs years 
      after the initial diagnosis. The result has potential implications for the 
      treatment of intractable epilepsy, suggesting that delaying surgical intervention 
      that may achieve seizure freedom may lead to functional network changes that are 
      no longer reversible by the time of epilepsy surgery.

      Comatose Patients.
PG  - 422-427
LID - 10.1177/1550059417715389 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring may help to identify the small 
      percentage of adults with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who will regain 
      consciousness if allowed sufficient time. However, the limited yield in this 
      population has led some to question the cost-effectiveness cEEG monitoring in 
      this population. We hypothesized that limited-montage cEEG could provide 
      essentially the same neurophysiologic information at lower cost. In this proof of 
      concept study, we aim to demonstrate the potentials of limited channel EEG in 
      prognostication in postanoxic patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cEEG 
      data from cases monitored at our institution with conventional 21-channel EEG 
      over a 6-month period. Twenty-eight cases were identified in which patients with 
      HIE underwent cEEG for at least 24 hours. Gold-standard findings were determined 
      by conventional visual analysis of the full cEEG, and 2 independent 
      electroencephalographers scored the same data using only limited-montage 
      (4-channel) views. The sensitivity and specificity of limited-montage cEEG review 
      were compared with conventional analysis. We also compared the relative costs of 
      conventional and limited-montage EEG. RESULTS: Using 4-channel limited montage 
      cEEG, reviewers were able to classify accurately background continuity (in 88%), 
      background amplitude (in 81%), maximum background frequency (in 70%), periodic 
      epileptiform discharges, including a seizure (in 92%) and sporadic discharges (in 
      91%). All epileptiform features were detected with greater than 90% sensitivity 
      and specificity. Eye movement artifact seen over bifrontal electrodes gave false 
      positive detections of periodic epileptiform discharges in 31% of cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Limited-channel continuous EEG monitoring can provide meaningful 
      electrophysiological data that can be used for prognostication in postanoxic 
      comatose patients. Limited channel EEG can be a cost-effective alternative to 
      conventional EEG monitoring in post-anoxic comatose patients.

TI  - Effects of Stimulus Duration on Event-Related Potentials Recorded From 
      Cochlear-Implant Users.
PG  - e389-e393
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000444 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several studies have investigated the feasibility of using 
      electrophysiology as an objective tool to efficiently map cochlear implants. A 
      pervasive problem when measuring event-related potentials is the need to remove 
      the direct-current (DC) artifact produced by the cochlear implant. Here, we 
      describe how DC artifact removal can corrupt the response waveform and how the 
      appropriate choice of stimulus duration may minimize this corruption. DESIGN: 
      Event-related potentials were recorded to a synthesized vowel /a/ with a 170- or 
      400-ms duration. RESULTS: The P2 response, which occurs between 150 and 250 ms, 
      was corrupted by the DC artifact removal algorithm for a 170-ms stimulus duration 
      but was relatively uncorrupted for a 400-ms stimulus duration. CONCLUSIONS: To 
      avoid response waveform corruption from DC artifact removal, one should choose a 
      stimulus duration such that the offset of the stimulus does not temporally 
      coincide with the specific peak of interest. While our data have been analyzed 
      with only one specific algorithm, we argue that the length of the stimulus may be 
      a critical factor for any DC artifact removal algorithm.

TI  - Feature Weight Driven Interactive Mutual Information Modeling for Heterogeneous 
      Bio-Signal Fusion to Estimate Mental Workload.
LID - 10.3390/s17102315 [doi]
LID - 2315
AB  - Many people suffer from high mental workload which may threaten human health and 
      cause serious accidents. Mental workload estimation is especially important for 
      particular people such as pilots, soldiers, crew and surgeons to guarantee the 
      safety and security. Different physiological signals have been used to estimate 
      mental workload based on the n-back task which is capable of inducing different 
      mental workload levels. This paper explores a feature weight driven signal fusion 
      method and proposes interactive mutual information modeling (IMIM) to increase 
      the mental workload classification accuracy. We used EEG and ECG signals to 
      validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for heterogeneous bio-signal 
      fusion. The experiment of mental workload estimation consisted of signal 
      recording, artifact removal, feature extraction, feature weight calculation, and 
      classification. Ten subjects were invited to take part in easy, medium and hard 
      tasks for the collection of EEG and ECG signals in different mental workload 
      levels. Therefore, heterogeneous physiological signals of different mental 
      workload states were available for classification. Experiments reveal that ECG 
      can be utilized as a supplement of EEG to optimize the fusion model and improve 
      mental workload estimation. Classification results show that the proposed 
      bio-signal fusion method IMIM can increase the classification accuracy in both 
      feature level and classifier level fusion. This study indicates that multi-modal 
      signal fusion is promising to identify the mental workload levels and the fusion 
      strategy has potential application of mental workload estimation in cognitive 
      activities during daily life.

LID - 10.1002/adhm.201700552 [doi]
AB  - The multichannel concentric-ring electrodes are stencil printed on stretchable 
      elastomers modified to improve adhesion to skin and minimize motion artifacts for 
      electrophysiological recordings of electroencephalography, electromyography, and 
      electrocardiography. These dry electrodes with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 
      polystyrene sulfonate interface layer are optimized to show lower noise level 
      than that of commercial gel disc electrodes. The concentric ring geometry enables 
      Laplacian filtering to pinpoint the bioelectric potential source with spatial 
      resolution determined by the ring distance. This work shows a new fabrication 
      approach to integrate and create designs that enhance spatial resolution for 
      high-quality electrophysiology monitoring devices.

TI  - Autoreject: Automated artifact rejection for MEG and EEG data.
PG  - 417-429
LID - S1053-8119(17)30501-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.030 [doi]
AB  - We present an automated algorithm for unified rejection and repair of bad trials 
      in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our 
      method capitalizes on cross-validation in conjunction with a robust evaluation 
      metric to estimate the optimal peak-to-peak threshold - a quantity commonly used 
      for identifying bad trials in M/EEG. This approach is then extended to a more 
      sophisticated algorithm which estimates this threshold for each sensor yielding 
      trial-wise bad sensors. Depending on the number of bad sensors, the trial is then 
      repaired by interpolation or by excluding it from subsequent analysis. All steps 
      of the algorithm are fully automated thus lending itself to the name Autoreject. 
      In order to assess the practical significance of the algorithm, we conducted 
      extensive validation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four public 
      datasets containing MEG and EEG recordings from more than 200 subjects. The 
      comparisons include purely qualitative efforts as well as quantitatively 
      benchmarking against human supervised and semi-automated preprocessing pipelines. 
      The algorithm allowed us to automate the preprocessing of MEG data from the Human 
      Connectome Project (HCP) going up to the computation of the evoked responses. The 
      automated nature of our method minimizes the burden of human inspection, hence 
      supporting scalability and reliability demanded by data analysis in modern 
      neuroscience.

TI  - Synchronizing the transcranial magnetic pulse with electroencephalographic 
      recordings effectively reduces inter-trial variability of the pulse artefact.
PG  - e0185154
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185154 [doi]
LID - e0185154
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) can capture the cortical response evoked 
      by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The TMS pulse provokes a large 
      artefact, which obscures the cortical response in the first milliseconds after 
      TMS. Removing this artefact remains a challenge. METHODS: We delivered monophasic 
      and biphasic TMS to a melon as head phantom and to four healthy participants and 
      recorded the pulse artefact at 5 kHz with a TMS-compatible EEG system. Pulse 
      delivery was either synchronized or non-synchronized to the clock of the EEG 
      recording system. The effects of synchronization were tested at 10 and 20 kHz 
      using the head phantom. We also tested the effect of a soft sheet placed between 
      the stimulation coil and recording electrodes in both human and melon. RESULTS & 
      CONCLUSION: Synchronizing TMS and data acquisition markedly reduced 
      trial-to-trial variability of the pulse artefact in recordings from the phantom 
      or from the scalp. Reduced trial-to-trial variability was also observed at high 
      sampling frequencies. The use of a soft sheet reduced the variability in 
      recordings on the head phantom, but not in human participants. Effective 
      reduction of the trial-to-trial variability renders it possible to create an 
      artefact template for off-line filtering. Template-based subtraction of the 
      artefact from the EEG signals is a prerequisite to effectively recover the 
      immediate physiological response in the stimulated cortex and inter-connected 
      areas.

AB  - A 54-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with an aneurysmal 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequently underwent mechanical ventilation and 
      received neuromuscular blocking drugs to control refractory elevated intracranial 
      pressure. During quantitative EEG monitoring, an automated alert was triggered by 
      the train of four peripheral nerve stimulation artifacts. Real-time feedback was 
      made possible due to remote monitoring. This case illustrates how computerized, 
      automated artificial intelligence algorithms can be used beyond typical seizure 
      detection in the intensive care unit for remote monitoring to benefit patient 
      care.

TI  - A Magnetic Resonance Compatible E4D Ultrasound Probe for Motion Management of 
      Radiation Therapy.
LID - 10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092223 [doi]
AB  - We developed a magnetic resonance compatible real-time, three-dimensional imaging 
      ultrasound probe for motion management of radiation therapy for liver cancer. The 
      probe contains an 18,000-element, 46.8 mm × 21.5 mm matrix array constructed from 
      three tiled transducer modules with integrated beamforming ASICs. The center 
      frequency and -6 dB fractional bandwidth of the probe was 3.6 MHz and 85 percent 
      respectively. Ferromagnetic materials in the acoustic stack, flex interconnect 
      and electronics boards were greatly minimized for magnetic resonance 
      compatibility. The probe and cable were shielded to minimize the impact of 
      radiofrequency noise on both the ultrasound and magnetic resonance images. The 
      probe's low-profile, side-viewing design allows it to be strapped to a patient so 
      that images may be acquired hands-free. We present simultaneously acquired 
      ultrasound and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance images with minimal artifacts in both 
      images.

TI  - Electroencephalographic Indicators in Default Mode, Habituation, and Visual-motor 
      Association in Female College Students.
PG  - 274-285
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oscillations, action, and postsynaptic potentials in glial-neuronal 
      ensembles integrate the spectral power (SP) of electroencephalographic (EEG). Our 
      objective is to propose SP indicators of healthy brains (control groups) based on 
      the default mode and their modifications by habituation and visual-motor 
      association (VM-asso), to support diagnostic and rehabilitation processes. 
      However, important differences seem to exist between men and women. Therefore, we 
      aim to analyze EEG characteristics in a female sample. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 
      the current study, EEG was recorded at rest with closed eyes before and during 
      repeated photostimulations (RPh) and before (pre) and during association of RPh 
      with switch pressing (VM-asso) in 70 female adults. EEG was analyzed using 
      UAM/INR software, which removes artifacts, identifies corresponding signals, 
      selects 20 samples (2-s) from each condition, applies Welch's periodogram to 
      calculate and average the absolute power (AP; AAPs) of ᵹ, θ, α, and β, before and 
      during learning, and emits data to a spreadsheet. Differences in each condition 
      were evaluated using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The AAPs were different; in 
      habituation, ᵹ and θ increased significantly in fronto-frontal (FF) and 
      frontocentral and decreased in the other leads. During association, they 
      increased in FF and decreased in the other three regions. α AAP decreased in all 
      leads except in FF during habituation, and the decrement was lower in the 
      association. β AAP increased in all leads during both learning conditions. 
      CONCLUSION: The SP and the topographic distribution are descriptive parameters of 
      habituation and VM-asso; we propose them as EEG indicators.

TI  - System for automatic heart rate calculation in epileptic seizures.
PG  - 555-564
LID - 10.1007/s13246-017-0557-z [doi]
AB  - This article presents a comprehensive system for automatic heart rate (HR) 
      detection. The system is robust and resistant to disturbances (noise, 
      interferences, artifacts) occurring mainly during epileptic seizures. ECG signal 
      filtration (IIR) and normalization due to skewness and standard deviation were 
      used as preprocessing steps. A key element of the system is a reference QRS 
      complex pattern calculated individually for each ECG recording. Next, a 
      cross-correlation of the reference QRS pattern with short, normalized ECG windows 
      is calculated and the maxima of the correlation are found (R-wave locations). 
      Determination of the RR intervals makes possible calculation of heart rate 
      changes and also heart rate variability (HRV). The algorithm was tested using a 
      simulation in which a noise of an amplitude several times higher than ECG 
      standard deviation levels was added. The proposed algorithm is characterized by 
      high QRS detection accuracy, and high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm 
      proved to be useful in clinical practice, where it was used to automatically 
      determine HR for ECG signals recorded before and during 58 focal seizures in 56 
      adult patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.

TI  - The Role of Visual Noise in Influencing Mental Load and Fatigue in a Steady-State 
      Motion Visual Evoked Potential-Based Brain-Computer Interface.
LID - 10.3390/s17081873 [doi]
LID - 1873
AB  - As a spatial selective attention-based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, 
      steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI has the advantages of high 
      information transfer rate, high tolerance to artifacts, and robust performance 
      across users. However, its benefits come at the cost of mental load and fatigue 
      occurring in the concentration on the visual stimuli. Noise, as a ubiquitous 
      random perturbation with the power of randomness, may be exploited by the human 
      visual system to enhance higher-level brain functions. In this study, a novel 
      steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP, i.e., one kind of 
      SSVEP)-based BCI paradigm with spatiotemporal visual noise was used to 
      investigate the influence of noise on the compensation of mental load and fatigue 
      deterioration during prolonged attention tasks. Changes in α, θ, θ + α powers, 
      θ/α ratio, and electroencephalography (EEG) properties of amplitude, 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and online accuracy, were used to evaluate mental 
      load and fatigue. We showed that presenting a moderate visual noise to 
      participants could reliably alleviate the mental load and fatigue during online 
      operation of visual BCI that places demands on the attentional processes. This 
      demonstrated that noise could provide a superior solution to the implementation 
      of visual attention controlling-based BCI applications.

TI  - Physiological artifacts in scalp EEG and ear-EEG.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s12938-017-0391-2 [doi]
LID - 103
AB  - BACKGROUND: A problem inherent to recording EEG is the interference arising from 
      noise and artifacts. While in a laboratory environment, artifacts and 
      interference can, to a large extent, be avoided or controlled, in real-life 
      scenarios this is a challenge. Ear-EEG is a concept where EEG is acquired from 
      electrodes in the ear. METHODS: We present a characterization of physiological 
      artifacts generated in a controlled environment for nine subjects. The influence 
      of the artifacts was quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
      deterioration of the auditory steady-state response. Alpha band modulation was 
      also studied in an open/closed eyes paradigm. RESULTS: Artifacts related to jaw 
      muscle contractions were present all over the scalp and in the ear, with the 
      highest SNR deteriorations in the gamma band. The SNR deterioration for jaw 
      artifacts were in general higher in the ear compared to the scalp. Whereas 
      eye-blinking did not influence the SNR in the ear, it was significant for all 
      groups of scalps electrodes in the delta and theta bands. Eye movements resulted 
      in statistical significant SNR deterioration in both frontal, temporal and ear 
      electrodes. Recordings of alpha band modulation showed increased power and 
      coherence of the EEG for ear and scalp electrodes in the closed-eyes periods. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ear-EEG is a method developed for unobtrusive and discreet recording 
      over long periods of time and in real-life environments. This study investigated 
      the influence of the most important types of physiological artifacts, and 
      demonstrated that spontaneous activity, in terms of alpha band oscillations, 
      could be recorded from the ear-EEG platform. In its present form ear-EEG was more 
      prone to jaw related artifacts and less prone to eye-blinking artifacts compared 
      to state-of-the-art scalp based systems.

AB  - Objectives: To compare quantitative EEG signal and test-retest reliability of 
      medical grade and consumer EEG systems. Methods: Resting state EEG was acquired 
      by two medical grade (B-Alert, Enobio) and two consumer (Muse, Mindwave) EEG 
      systems in five healthy subjects during two study visits. EEG patterns, power 
      spectral densities (PSDs) and test/retest reliability in eyes closed and eyes 
      open conditions were compared across the four systems, focusing on Fp1, the only 
      common electrode. Fp1 PSDs were obtained using Welch's modified periodogram 
      method and averaged for the five subjects for each visit. The test/retest results 
      were calculated as a ratio of Visit 1/Visit 2 Fp1 channel PSD at each 1 s epoch. 
      Results: B-Alert, Enobio, and Mindwave Fp1 power spectra were similar. Muse 
      showed a broadband increase in power spectra and the highest relative variation 
      across test-retest acquisitions. Consumer systems were more prone to artifact due 
      to eye blinks and muscle movement in the frontal region. Conclusions: EEG data 
      can be successfully collected from all four systems tested. Although there was 
      slightly more time required for application, medical systems offer clear 
      advantages in data quality, reliability, and depth of analysis over the consumer 
      systems. Significance: This evaluation provides evidence for informed selection 
      of EEG systemsappropriate for clinical trials.

AB  - Biosignals are usually contaminated with artifacts from limb movements, muscular 
      contraction or electrical interference. Many algorithms of the literature, such 
      as threshold methods and adaptive filters, focus on detecting these noisy 
      patterns. This study introduces a novel method for noise and artifact detection 
      in electrocardiogram based on time series clustering. The algorithm starts with 
      the extraction of features that best characterize the shape and behaviour of the 
      signal over time and groups its samples in separated clusters by means of an 
      agglomerative clustering approach. The method has been tested in numerous 
      datasets to reveal that it is independent on specific records and globally, the 
      algorithm was able to successfully detect noisy patterns and artifacts with a 
      sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 91%, demonstrating a 
      good performance in pattern detection based on morphological clustering. This 
      algorithm can be applied to the detection and sectioning of multiple types of 
      noise for more accurate denoising and adapted for signal classification.

TI  - A new multivariate empirical mode decomposition method for improving the 
      performance of SSVEP-based brain-computer interface.
PG  - 046028
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/aa6a23 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate and efficient detection of steady-state visual evoked 
      potentials (SSVEP) in electroencephalogram (EEG) is essential for the related 
      brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. APPROACH: Although the canonical 
      correlation analysis (CCA) has been applied extensively and successfully to SSVEP 
      recognition, the spontaneous EEG activities and artifacts that often occur during 
      data recording can deteriorate the recognition performance. Therefore, it is 
      meaningful to extract a few frequency sub-bands of interest to avoid or reduce 
      the influence of unrelated brain activity and artifacts. This paper presents an 
      improved method to detect the frequency component associated with SSVEP using 
      multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and CCA (MEMD-CCA). EEG signals 
      from nine healthy volunteers were recorded to evaluate the performance of the 
      proposed method for SSVEP recognition. MAIN RESULTS: We compared our method with 
      CCA and temporally local multivariate synchronization index (TMSI). The results 
      suggest that the MEMD-CCA achieved significantly higher accuracy in contrast to 
      standard CCA and TMSI. It gave the improvements of 1.34%, 3.11%, 3.33%, 10.45%, 
      15.78%, 18.45%, 15.00% and 14.22% on average over CCA at time windows from 0.5 s 
      to 5 s and 0.55%, 1.56%, 7.78%, 14.67%, 13.67%, 7.33% and 7.78% over TMSI from 
      0.75 s to 5 s. The method outperformed the filter-based decomposition (FB), 
      empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet decomposition (WT) based CCA for 
      SSVEP recognition. SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate the ability of our 
      proposed MEMD-CCA to improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI.

TI  - Hybrid Cubature Kalman filtering for identifying nonlinear models from sampled 
      recording: Estimation of neuronal dynamics.
PG  - e0181513
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0181513 [doi]
LID - e0181513
AB  - Kalman filtering methods have long been regarded as efficient adaptive Bayesian 
      techniques for estimating hidden states in models of linear dynamical systems 
      under Gaussian uncertainty. Recent advents of the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) 
      have extended this efficient estimation property to nonlinear systems, and also 
      to hybrid nonlinear problems where by the processes are continuous and the 
      observations are discrete (continuous-discrete CD-CKF). Employing CKF techniques, 
      therefore, carries high promise for modeling many biological phenomena where the 
      underlying processes exhibit inherently nonlinear, continuous, and noisy dynamics 
      and the associated measurements are uncertain and time-sampled. This paper 
      investigates the performance of cubature filtering (CKF and CD-CKF) in two 
      flagship problems arising in the field of neuroscience upon relating brain 
      functionality to aggregate neurophysiological recordings: (i) estimation of the 
      firing dynamics and the neural circuit model parameters from electric potentials 
      (EP) observations, and (ii) estimation of the hemodynamic model parameters and 
      the underlying neural drive from BOLD (fMRI) signals. First, in simulated neural 
      circuit models, estimation accuracy was investigated under varying levels of 
      observation noise (SNR), process noise structures, and observation sampling 
      intervals (dt). When compared to the CKF, the CD-CKF consistently exhibited 
      better accuracy for a given SNR, sharp accuracy increase with higher SNR, and 
      persistent error reduction with smaller dt. Remarkably, CD-CKF accuracy shows 
      only a mild deterioration for non-Gaussian process noise, specifically with 
      Poisson noise, a commonly assumed form of background fluctuations in neuronal 
      systems. Second, in simulated hemodynamic models, parametric estimates were 
      consistently improved under CD-CKF. Critically, time-localization of the 
      underlying neural drive, a determinant factor in fMRI-based functional 
      connectivity studies, was significantly more accurate under CD-CKF. In 
      conclusion, and with the CKF recently benchmarked against other advanced Bayesian 
      techniques, the CD-CKF framework could provide significant gains in robustness 
      and accuracy when estimating a variety of biological phenomena models where the 
      underlying process dynamics unfold at time scales faster than those seen in 
      collected measurements.

TI  - Isolating Discriminant Neural Activity in the Presence of Eye Movements and 
      Concurrent Task Demands.
PG  - 357

AB  - A growing number of studies use the combination of eye-tracking and 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) measures to explore the neural processes that 
      underlie visual perception. In these studies, fixation-related potentials (FRPs) 
      are commonly used to quantify early and late stages of visual processing that 
      follow the onset of each fixation. However, FRPs reflect a mixture of bottom-up 
      (sensory-driven) and top-down (goal-directed) processes, in addition to eye 
      movement artifacts and unrelated neural activity. At present there is little 
      consensus on how to separate this evoked response into its constituent elements. 
      In this study we sought to isolate the neural sources of target detection in the 
      presence of eye movements and over a range of concurrent task demands. Here, 
      participants were asked to identify visual targets (Ts) amongst a grid of 
      distractor stimuli (Ls), while simultaneously performing an auditory N-back task. 
      To identify the discriminant activity, we used independent components analysis 
      (ICA) for the separation of EEG into neural and non-neural sources. We then 
      further separated the neural sources, using a modified measure-projection 
      approach, into six regions of interest (ROIs): occipital, fusiform, temporal, 
      parietal, cingulate, and frontal cortices. Using activity from these ROIs, we 
      identified target from non-target fixations in all participants at a level 
      similar to other state-of-the-art classification techniques. Importantly, we 
      isolated the time course and spectral features of this discriminant activity in 
      each ROI. In addition, we were able to quantify the effect of cognitive load on 
      both fixation-locked potential and classification performance across regions. 
      Together, our results show the utility of a measure-projection approach for 
      separating task-relevant neural activity into meaningful ROIs within more complex 
      contexts that include eye movements.

AB  - We report development, testing, and in vivo characterization of a multichannel 
      optical probe for continuous wave (CW) functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (fNIRS) that relies on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) detectors. SiPMs are 
      cheap, low voltage, and robust semiconductor light detectors with performances 
      analogous to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). In contrast with PMTs, SiPMs allow 
      direct contact with the head and transfer of the analog signals through thin 
      cables greatly increasing the system flexibility avoiding optical fibers. The 
      coupling of SiPMs and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made the optical probe 
      lightweight and robust against motion artifacts. After characterization of SiPM 
      performances, which was proven to provide a noise equivalent power below 3 fW, 
      the apparatus was compared through an in vivo experiment to a commercial system 
      relying on laser diodes, PMTs, and optical fibers for light probing and 
      detection. The optical probes were located over the primary sensorimotor cortex 
      and the similarities between the hemodynamic responses to the contralateral motor 
      task were assessed. When compared to other state-of-the-art wearable fNIRS 
      systems, where photodiode detectors are employed, the single photon sensitivity 
      and dynamic range of SiPMs can fully exploit the long and variable interoptode 
      distances needed for correct estimation of brain hemodynamics using CW-fNIRS.

TI  - ICA-Based Imagined Conceptual Words Classification on EEG Signals.
PG  - 130-144
AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) has been used for detecting and removing the 
      eye artifacts conventionally. However, in this research, it was used not only for 
      detecting the eye artifacts, but also for detecting the brain-produced signals of 
      two conceptual danger and information category words. In this cross-sectional 
      research, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using Micromed and 
      19-channel helmet devices in unipolar mode, wherein Cz electrode was selected as 
      the reference electrode. In the first part of this research, the statistical 
      community test case included four men and four women, who were 25-30 years old. 
      In the designed task, three groups of traffic signs were considered, in which two 
      groups referred to the concept of danger, and the third one referred to the 
      concept of information. In the second part, the three volunteers, two men and one 
      woman, who had the best results, were chosen from among eight participants. In 
      the second designed task, direction arrows (up, down, left, and right) were used. 
      For the 2/8 volunteers in the rest times, very high-power alpha waves were 
      observed from the back of the head; however, in the thinking times, they were 
      different. According to this result, alpha waves for changing the task from 
      thinking to rest condition took at least 3 s for the two volunteers, and it was 
      at most 5 s until they went to the absolute rest condition. For the 7/8 
      volunteers, the danger and information signals were well classified; these 
      differences for the 5/8 volunteers were observed in the right hemisphere, and, 
      for the other three volunteers, the differences were observed in the left 
      hemisphere. For the second task, simulations showed that the best classification 
      accuracies resulted when the time window was 2.5 s. In addition, it also showed 
      that the features of the autoregressive (AR)-15 model coefficients were the best 
      choices for extracting the features. For all the states of neural network except 
      hardlim discriminator function, the classification accuracies were almost the 
      same and not very different. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in comparison 
      with the neural network yielded higher classification accuracies. ICA is a 
      suitable algorithm for recognizing of the word's concept and its place in the 
      brain. Achieved results from this experiment were the same compared with the 
      results from other methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and 
      methods based on the brain signals (EEG) in the vowel imagination and covert 
      speech. Herein, the highest classification accuracy was obtained by extracting 
      the target signal from the output of the ICA and extracting the features of 
      coefficients AR model with time interval of 2.5 s. Finally, LDA resulted in the 
      highest classification accuracy more than 60%.

TI  - Kinematics and neuromuscular recruitment during vertical treadmill exercise.
PG  - 307-314
LID - 10.12965/jer.1734916.458 [doi]
AB  - The vertical treadmill (VertiRun) is an unresearched, partial weight-bearing 
      exercise mode for lower limb rehabilitation. The user undertakes a "running-like" 
      action whilst body weight is supported by a bench and the limb is drawn downwards 
      against overhanging resistance cables on a vertically hung nonmotorised 
      treadmill. This study sought to describe the kinematics and neuromuscular 
      recruitment during VertiRun exercise in the supine, 40°, and 70° postures. 
      Twenty-one healthy male participants (age, 25±7 years; stature, 1.79±0.07 m; body 
      mass, 77.7±8.8 kg) volunteered for sagittal plane kinematic analysis of the 
      ankle, knee and hip and electromyography of lower limb musculature in all three 
      postures. Results indicated similar kinematic and neuromuscular profiles in the 
      40° and 70° postures which differed from the supine. Regardless of posture, a 
      basic movement pattern was observed where the hamstrings and gastrocnemius 
      muscles were active to extend the hip, flex the knee, plantarflex the ankle and 
      draw the leg down the treadmill belt in the contact phase. The rectus femoris and 
      tibialis anterior were active to flex the hip and knee, and dorsiflex the ankle 
      to draw the leg upwards during the swing phase. The vasti muscles were not active 
      during VertiRun exercise. The VertiRun demonstrated similar kinematic and 
      neuro-muscular patterns to overground gait, allows workload progression based on 
      effort and posture changes, and is a low-impact exercise mode that could maintain 
      physical fitness without loading injured tissues. This study suggests that the 
      VertiRun could supplement rehabilitation programmes for lower-limb injuries.

LID - e3474
AB  - Artifacts removal and rhythms extraction from electroencephalography (EEG) 
      signals are important for portable and wearable EEG recording devices. 
      Incorporating a novel grouping rule, we proposed an adaptive singular spectrum 
      analysis (SSA) method for artifacts removal and rhythms extraction. Based on the 
      EEG signal amplitude, the grouping rule determines adaptively the first one or 
      two SSA reconstructed components as artifacts and removes them. The remaining 
      reconstructed components are then grouped based on their peak frequencies in the 
      Fourier transform to extract the desired rhythms. The grouping rule thus enables 
      SSA to be adaptive to EEG signals containing different levels of artifacts and 
      rhythms. The simulated EEG data based on the Markov Process Amplitude (MPA) EEG 
      model and the experimental EEG data in the eyes-open and eyes-closed states were 
      used to verify the adaptive SSA method. Results showed a better performance in 
      artifacts removal and rhythms extraction, compared with the wavelet decomposition 
      (WDec) and another two recently reported SSA methods. Features of the extracted 
      alpha rhythms using adaptive SSA were calculated to distinguish between the 
      eyes-open and eyes-closed states. Results showed a higher accuracy (95.8%) than 
      those of the WDec method (79.2%) and the infinite impulse response (IIR) 
      filtering method (83.3%).

TI  - High Amplitude EEG Motor Potential during Repetitive Foot Movement: Possible Use 
      and Challenges for Futuristic BCIs That Restore Mobility after Spinal Cord 
      Injury.
PG  - 362

AB  - Recent advances in neuroprostheses provide us with promising ideas of how to 
      improve the quality of life in people suffering from impaired motor functioning 
      of upper and lower limbs. Especially for patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), 
      futuristic devices that are controlled by thought via brain-computer interfaces 
      (BCIs) might be of tremendous help in managing daily tasks and restoring at least 
      some mobility. However, there are certain problems arising when trying to 
      implement BCI technology especially in such a heterogenous patient group. A 
      plethora of processes occurring after the injuries change the brain's structure 
      as well as its functionality collectively referred to as neuroplasticity. These 
      changes are very different between individuals, leading to an increasing interest 
      to reveal the exact changes occurring after SCI. In this study we investigated 
      event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from electroencephalography (EEG) signals 
      recorded during the (attempted) execution and imagination of hand and foot 
      movements in healthy subjects and patients with SCI. As ERPs and especially early 
      components are of interest for BCI research we aimed to investigate differences 
      between 22 healthy volunteers and 7 patients (mean age = 51.86, SD = 15.49) 
      suffering from traumatic or non-traumatic SCI since 2-314 months (mean = 116,57, 
      SD = 125,55). We aimed to explore differences in ERP responses as well as the 
      general presence of component that might be of interest to further consider for 
      incorporation into BCI research. In order to match the real-life situation of 
      BCIs for controlling neuroprostheses, we worked on small trial numbers (<25), 
      only. We obtained a focal potential over Pz in ten healthy participants but in 
      none of the patients after lenient artifact rejection. The potential was 
      characterized by a high amplitude, it correlated with the repeated movements (6 
      times in 6 s) and in nine subjects it significantly differed from a resting 
      condition. Furthermore, there are strong arguments against possible confounding 
      factors leading to the potential's appearance. This phenomenon, occurring when 
      movements are repeatedly conducted, might represent a possible potential to be 
      used in futuristic BCIs and further studies should try to investigate the 
      replicability of its appearance.

AB  - The processing of EEG data routinely involves subjective removal of artifacts 
      during a preprocessing stage. Preprocessing inter-rater reliability (IRR) and how 
      differences in preprocessing may affect outcomes of primary event-related 
      potential (ERP) analyses has not been previously assessed. Three raters 
      independently preprocessed EEG data of 16 cognitively healthy adult participants 
      (ages 18-39 years) who performed a memory task. Using intraclass correlations 
      (ICCs), IRR was assessed for Early-frontal, Late-frontal, and Parietal Old/new 
      memory effects contrasts across eight regions of interest (ROIs). IRR was good to 
      excellent for all ROIs; 22 of 26 ICCs were above 0.80. Raters were highly 
      consistent in preprocessing across ROIs, although the frontal pole ROI (ICC range 
      0.60-0.90) showed less consistency. Old/new parietal effects had highest ICCs 
      with the lowest variability. Rater preprocessing differences did not alter 
      primary ERP results. IRR for EEG preprocessing was good to excellent, and 
      subjective rater-removal of EEG artifacts did not alter primary memory-task ERP 
      results. Findings provide preliminary support for robustness of cognitive/memory 
      task-related ERP results against significant inter-rater preprocessing 
      variability and suggest reliability of EEG to assess cognitive-neurophysiological 
      processes multiple preprocessors are involved.

      during Working Memory Tasks.
LID - 10.3390/s17061326 [doi]
LID - 1326
AB  - Characterizing dementia is a global challenge in supporting personalized health 
      care. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis 
      and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the 
      brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor 
      with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of 
      five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The 
      objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG 
      signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component 
      analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; 
      second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that 
      characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. 
      The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the 
      independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step 
      artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual 
      components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and 
      denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs 
      were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the 
      proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based 
      on AICA and WT denoising methods using cross-correlation X C o r r and peak 
      signal to noise ratio ( P S N R ) (ANOVA, p ˂ 0.05). The AICA-WT technique 
      exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would 
      be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared 
      with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p ˂ 0.05). Therefore, 
      this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and 
      stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background 
      activities that can help to provide useful diagnostic indexes by using EEG signal 
      processing.

      Learning.
PG  - 109-123
LID - 10.1007/s10776-017-0346-3 [doi]
AB  - We have developed two new methods that use sparse recovery and active learning 
      techniques for near real-time artifact identification and removal in EEG 
      recordings. The first algorithm, called Correlated Sparse Signal Recovery (CSSR) 
      addresses the problem of structured sparse signal recovery when statistical 
      rather than exact properties describing the structure of the signal are 
      appropriate, as in the elimination of eye movement artifacts; such tasks cannot 
      be done efficiently using structured models that assume a common sparsity profile 
      of fixed groups of components. Our algorithm learns structured sparse 
      coefficients in a Bayesian paradigm. Using it, we have successfully identified 
      and subtracted eye movement (structured) artifacts in real EEG recordings 
      resulting in minimal data loss. Our method outperforms ICA and standard sparse 
      recovery algorithms by preserving both spectral and complexity properties of the 
      denoised EEG. Our second method uses a new active selection algorithm that we 
      call Output-based Active Selection (OAS). When applied to the task of detection 
      of EEG epochs containing other non-structured artifacts from an ensemble of 
      detectors, OAS boosts accuracy of the ensemble from 91% to 97.5% with only 10% 
      active labels. Our methods can also be applied to real-time artifact removal in 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and blood pressure signals.

TI  - Robust presurgical functional MRI at 7 T using response consistency.
PG  - 3163-3174
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23582 [doi]
AB  - Functional MRI is valuable in presurgical planning due to its non-invasive 
      nature, repeatability, and broad availability. Using ultra-high field MRI 
      increases the specificity and sensitivity, increasing the localization 
      reliability and reducing scan time. Ideally, fMRI analysis for this application 
      should identify unreliable runs and work even if the patient deviates from the 
      prescribed task timing or if there are changes to the hemodynamic response due to 
      pathology. In this study, a model-free analysis method-UNBIASED-based on the 
      consistency of fMRI responses over runs was applied, to ultra-high field fMRI 
      localizations of the hand area. Ten patients with brain tumors and epilepsy 
      underwent 7 Tesla fMRI with multiple runs of a hand motor task in a block design. 
      FMRI data were analyzed with the proposed approach (UNBIASED) and the 
      conventional General Linear Model (GLM) approach. UNBIASED correctly identified 
      and excluded fMRI runs that contained little or no activation. Generally, less 
      motion artifact contamination was present in UNBIASED than in GLM results. Some 
      cortical regions were identified as activated in UNBIASED but not GLM results. 
      These were confirmed to show reproducible delayed or transient activation, which 
      was time-locked to the task. UNBIASED is a robust approach to generating 
      activation maps without the need for assumptions about response timing or shape. 
      In presurgical planning, UNBIASED can complement model-based methods to aid 
      surgeons in making prudent choices about optimal surgical access and resection 
      margins for each patient, even if the hemodynamic response is modified by 
      pathology. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3163-3174, 2017. © 2017 The Authors Human Brain

TI  - A Review of Issues Related to Data Acquisition and Analysis in EEG/MEG Studies.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci7060058 [doi]
LID - 58
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive 
      electrophysiological methods, which record electric potentials and magnetic 
      fields due to electric currents in synchronously-active neurons. With MEG being 
      more sensitive to neural activity from tangential currents and EEG being able to 
      detect both radial and tangential sources, the two methods are complementary. 
      Over the years, neurophysiological studies have changed considerably: 
      high-density recordings are becoming de rigueur; there is interest in both 
      spontaneous and evoked activity; and sophisticated artifact detection and removal 
      methods are available. Improved head models for source estimation have also 
      increased the precision of the current estimates, particularly for EEG and 
      combined EEG/MEG. Because of their complementarity, more investigators are 
      beginning to perform simultaneous EEG/MEG studies to gain more complete 
      information about neural activity. Given the increase in methodological 
      complexity in EEG/MEG, it is important to gather data that are of high quality 
      and that are as artifact free as possible. Here, we discuss some issues in data 
      acquisition and analysis of EEG and MEG data. Practical considerations for 
      different types of EEG and MEG studies are also discussed.

TI  - Safety and EEG data quality of concurrent high-density EEG and high-speed fMRI at 
      3 Tesla.
PG  - e0178409

AB  - PURPOSE: Concurrent EEG and fMRI is increasingly used to characterize the 
      spatial-temporal dynamics of brain activity. However, most studies to date have 
      been limited to conventional echo-planar imaging (EPI). There is considerable 
      interest in integrating recently developed high-speed fMRI methods with 
      high-density EEG to increase temporal resolution and sensitivity for task-based 
      and resting state fMRI, and for detecting interictal spikes in epilepsy. In the 
      present study using concurrent high-density EEG and recently developed high-speed 
      fMRI methods, we investigate safety of radiofrequency (RF) related heating, the 
      effect of EEG on cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI, and assess EEG 
      data quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study compared EPI, multi-echo EPI, 
      multi-band EPI and multi-slab echo-volumar imaging pulse sequences, using 
      clinical 3 Tesla MR scanners from two different vendors that were equipped with 
      64- and 256-channel MR-compatible EEG systems, respectively, and receive only 
      array head coils. Data were collected in 11 healthy controls (3 males, age range 
      18-70 years) and 13 patients with epilepsy (8 males, age range 21-67 years). 
      Three of the healthy controls were scanned with the 256-channel EEG system, the 
      other subjects were scanned with the 64-channel EEG system. Scalp surface 
      temperature, SNR in occipital cortex and head movement were measured with and 
      without the EEG cap. The degree of artifacts and the ability to identify 
      background activity was assessed by visual analysis by a trained expert in the 64 
      channel EEG data (7 healthy controls, 13 patients). RESULTS: RF induced heating 
      at the surface of the EEG electrodes during a 30-minute scan period with stable 
      temperature prior to scanning did not exceed 1.0° C with either EEG system and 
      any of the pulse sequences used in this study. There was no significant decrease 
      in cortical SNR due to the presence of the EEG cap (p > 0.05). No significant 
      differences in the visually analyzed EEG data quality were found between EEG 
      recorded during high-speed fMRI and during conventional EPI (p = 0.78). Residual 
      ballistocardiographic artifacts resulted in 58% of EEG data being rated as poor 
      quality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that high-density EEG can be safely 
      implemented in conjunction with high-speed fMRI and that high-speed fMRI does not 
      adversely affect EEG data quality. However, the deterioration of the EEG quality 
      due to residual ballistocardiographic artifacts remains a significant constraint 
      for routine clinical applications of concurrent EEG-fMRI.

AB  - PURPOSE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown to be an effective treatment for 
      drug resistant epilepsy, with achieving more than 50% seizure reduction in one 
      third of the treated patients. In order to predict which patients will profit 
      from VNS, we previously found that a low pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index 
      (pdBSI) could potentially predict good responders to VNS treatment. These 
      findings however have to be validated before they can be generalized. METHODS: 39 
      patients (age 18-68 years) with medically intractable epilepsy who were referred 
      for an implanted VNS system were included. Routine EEG registrations, recorded 
      before implantation, were analyzed. Artefact-free epochs with eyes open and eyes 
      closed were quantitatively analyzed. The pdBSI was tested for relation with VNS 
      outcome one year after surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (59%) obtained a 
      reduction in seizure frequency, of whom ten (26%) had a reduction of at least 50% 
      (good responders) and thirteen (33%) a reduction of less than 50% (moderate 
      responders). Sixteen patients without seizure reduction are defined as 
      non-responders. No significant differences were found in the pdBSI of good 
      responders (mean 0.27), moderate responders (mean 0.26) and non-responders (mean 
      0.25) (p>0.05). Besides seizure reduction, many patients (56%) reported 
      additional positive effects of VNS in terms of seizure duration, seizure 
      intensity and/or postictal recovery. CONCLUSION: EEG features that correlate with 
      VNS therapy outcome may enable better patient selection and prevent unnecessary 
      VNS surgery. Contrary to earlier findings, this validation study suggests that 
      pdBSI might not be helpful to predict VNS therapy outcome.

TI  - Effects of force load, muscle fatigue and extremely low frequency magnetic 
      stimulation on EEG signals during side arm lateral raise task.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was to quantitatively investigate the effects of force 
      load, muscle fatigue and extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic stimulation on 
      electroencephalography (EEG) signal features during side arm lateral raise task. 
      APPROACH: EEG signals were recorded by a BIOSEMI Active Two system with Pin-Type 
      active-electrodes from 18 healthy subjects when they performed the right arm side 
      lateral raise task (90° away from the body) with three different loads (0 kg, 
      1 kg and 3 kg; their order was randomized among the subjects) on the forearm. The 
      arm maintained the loads until the subject felt exhausted. The first 10 s 
      recording for each load was regarded as non-fatigue status and the last 10 s 
      before the subject was exhausted as fatigue status. The subject was then given a 
      5 min resting between different loads. Two days later, the same experiment was 
      performed on each subject except that ELF magnetic stimulation was applied to the 
      subject's deltoid muscle during the 5 min resting period. EEG features from C3 
      and C4 electrodes including the power of alpha, beta and gamma and sample entropy 
      were analyzed and compared between different loads, non-fatigue/fatigue status, 
      and with/without ELF magnetic stimulation. MAIN RESULTS: The key results were 
      associated with the change of the power of alpha band. From both C3-EEG and 
      C4-EEG, with 1 kg and 3 kg force loads, the power of alpha band was significantly 
      smaller than that from 0 kg for both non-fatigue and fatigue periods (all 
      p  <  0.05). However, no significant difference of the power in alpha between 
      1 kg and 3 kg was observed (p  >  0.05 for all the force loads except C4-EEG with 
      ELF simulation). The power of alpha band at fatigue status was significantly 
      increased for both C3-EEG and C4-EEG when compared with the non-fatigue status 
      (p  <  0.01 for all the force loads except 3 kg force from C4-EEG). With magnetic 
      stimulation, the powers of alpha from C3-EEG and C4-EEG were significantly 
      decreased than without stimulation (all p  <  0.05), and the difference in the 
      power of alpha between fatigue and non-fatigue status disappeared with 1 kg and 
      3 kg force loads, The powers of beta and gamma bands and SampEn were not 
      significantly different between different force loads, between fatigue and 
      non-fatigue status, and between with and without ELF magnetic stimulation (all 
      p  >  0.05, except between non-fatigue and fatigue with magnetic stimulation in 
      gamma band of C3-EEG at 1 kg, and in the SampEn at 1 kg and 3 kg force loads from 
      C4-EEG). SIGNIFICANCE: Our study comprehensively quantified the effects of force, 
      fatigue and the ELF magnetic stimulation on EEG features with difference forces, 
      fatigue status and ELF magnetic stimulation.

TI  - Evaluating the efficacy of fully automated approaches for the selection of 
      eyeblink ICA components.
PG  - 780-791
LID - 10.1111/psyp.12827 [doi]
AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) offers a powerful approach for the isolation 
      and removal of eyeblink artifacts from EEG signals. Manual identification of the 
      eyeblink ICA component by inspection of scalp map projections, however, is prone 
      to error, particularly when nonartifactual components exhibit topographic 
      distributions similar to the blink. The aim of the present investigation was to 
      determine the extent to which automated approaches for selecting eyeblink-related 
      ICA components could be utilized to replace manual selection. We evaluated 
      popular blink selection methods relying on spatial features (EyeCatch), combined 
      stereotypical spatial and temporal features (ADJUST), and a novel method relying 
      on time series features alone (icablinkmetrics) using both simulated and real EEG 
      data. The results of this investigation suggest that all three methods of 
      automatic component selection are able to accurately identify eyeblink-related 
      ICA components at or above the level of trained human observers. However, 
      icablinkmetrics, in particular, appears to provide an effective means of 
      automating ICA artifact rejection while at the same time eliminating human errors 
      inevitable during manual component selection and false positive component 
      identifications common in other automated approaches. Based upon these findings, 
      best practices for (a) identifying artifactual components via automated means, 
      and (b) reducing the accidental removal of signal-related ICA components are 
      discussed.

      Recordings during Walking.

AB  - Recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during human motion can introduce 
      motion artifacts. Repetitive head movements can generate artifact patterns across 
      scalp EEG sensors. There are many methods for identifying and rejecting bad 
      channels and independent components from EEG datasets, but there is a lack of 
      methods dedicated to evaluate specific intra-channel amplitude patterns for 
      identifying motion-related artifacts. In this study, we proposed a template 
      correlation rejection (TCR) as a novel method for identifying and rejecting EEG 
      channels and independent components carrying motion-related artifacts. We 
      recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during treadmill walking. The template 
      correlation rejection method consists of creating templates of amplitude patterns 
      and determining the fraction of total epochs presenting relevant correlation to 
      the template. For EEG channels, the template correlation rejection removed 
      channels presenting the majority of epochs (>75%) correlated to the template, and 
      presenting pronounced amplitude in comparison to all recorded channels. For 
      independent components, the template correlation rejection removed components 
      presenting the majority of epochs correlated to the template. Evaluation of scalp 
      maps and power spectra confirmed low neural content for the rejected components. 
      We found that channels identified for rejection contained ~60% higher delta 
      power, and had spectral properties locked to the gait phases. After rejecting the 
      identified channels and running independent component analysis on the EEG 
      datasets, the proposed method identified 4.3 ± 1.8 independent components (out of 
      198 ± 12) with substantive motion-related artifacts. These results indicate that 
      template correlation rejection is an effective method for rejecting EEG channels 
      contaminated with motion-related artifact during human locomotion.

AB  - As the number of people diagnosed with movement disorders is increasing, it 
      becomes vital to design techniques that allow the better understanding of human 
      brain in naturalistic settings. There are many brain imaging methods such as 
      fMRI, SPECT, and MEG that provide the functional information of the brain. 
      However, these techniques have some limitations including immobility, cost, and 
      motion artifacts. One of the most emerging portable brain scanners available 
      today is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). In this study, we have 
      conducted fNIRS neuroimaging of seven healthy subjects while they were performing 
      wrist tasks such as flipping their hand with the periods of rest (no movement). 
      Different models of support vector machine is applied to these fNIRS neuroimaging 
      data and the results show that we could classify the action and rest periods with 
      the accuracy of over 80% for the fNIRS data of individual participants. Our 
      results are promising and suggest that the presented classification method for 
      fNIRS could further be applied to real-time applications such as brain computer 
      interfacing (BCI), and into the future steps of this research to record brain 
      activity from fNIRS and EEG, and fuse them with the body motion sensors to 
      correlate the activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated process for sleep staging based on intracranial EEG data 
      alone is needed to facilitate research into the neural processes occurring during 
      slow wave sleep (SWS). Current manual methods for sleep scoring require a full 
      polysomnography (PSG) set-up, including electrooculography (EOG), 
      electromyography (EMG), and scalp electroencephalography (EEG). This set-up can 
      be technically difficult to place in the presence of intracranial EEG electrodes. 
      There is thus a need for a method for sleep staging based on intracranial 
      recordings alone. NEW METHOD: Here we show a reliable automated method for the 
      detection of periods of SWS solely based on intracranial EEG recordings. The 
      method utilizes the ratio of spectral power in delta, theta, and spindle 
      frequencies relative to alpha and beta frequencies to classify 30-s segments as 
      SWS or not. RESULTS: We evaluated this new method by comparing its performance 
      against visually scored patients (n=9), in which we also recorded EOG and EMG 
      simultaneously. Our method had a mean positive predictive value of 64% across all 
      nights. Also, an ROC analysis of the performance of our algorithm compared to 
      manually labeled nights revealed a mean average area under the curve of 0.91 
      across all nights. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Our method had an average 
      kappa score of 0.72 when compared to visual sleep scoring by an independent 
      blinded sleep scorer. CONCLUSION: This shows that this simple method is capable 
      of differentiating between SWS and non-SWS epochs reliably based solely on 
      intracranial EEG recordings.

AB  - This review examined 83 articles using neuroimaging modalities to investigate the 
      neural correlates underlying static and dynamic human balance control, with aims 
      to support future mobile neuroimaging research in the balance control domain. 
      Furthermore, this review analyzed the mobility of the neuroimaging hardware and 
      research paradigms as well as the analytical methodology to identify and remove 
      movement artifact in the acquired brain signal. We found that the majority of 
      static balance control tasks utilized mechanical perturbations to invoke 
      feet-in-place responses (27 out of 38 studies), while cognitive dual-task 
      conditions were commonly used to challenge balance in dynamic balance control 
      tasks (20 out of 32 studies). While frequency analysis and event related 
      potential characteristics supported enhanced brain activation during static 
      balance control, that in dynamic balance control studies was supported by spatial 
      and frequency analysis. Twenty-three of the 50 studies utilizing EEG utilized 
      independent component analysis to remove movement artifacts from the acquired 
      brain signals. Lastly, only eight studies used truly mobile neuroimaging hardware 
      systems. This review provides evidence to support an increase in brain activation 
      in balance control tasks, regardless of mechanical, cognitive, or sensory 
      challenges. Furthermore, the current body of literature demonstrates the use of 
      advanced signal processing methodologies to analyze brain activity during 
      movement. However, the static nature of neuroimaging hardware and conventional 
      balance control paradigms prevent full mobility and limit our knowledge of neural 
      mechanisms underlying balance control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Slow wave sleep (SWS) plays an important role in neurophysiologic 
      restoration. Experimentally testing the effect of SWS disruption previously 
      required highly time-intensive and subjective methods. Our goal was to develop an 
      automated and objective protocol to reduce SWS without affecting sleep 
      architecture. NEW METHOD: We developed a custom Matlab™ protocol to calculate 
      electroencephalogram spectral power every 10s live during a polysomnogram, 
      exclude artifact, and, if measurements met criteria for SWS, deliver increasingly 
      louder tones through earphones. Middle-aged healthy volunteers (n=10) each 
      underwent 2 polysomnograms, one with the SWS disruption protocol and one with 
      sham condition. RESULTS: The SWS disruption protocol reduced SWS compared to sham 
      condition, as measured by spectral power in the delta (0.5-4Hz) band, 
      particularly in the 0.5-2Hz range (mean 20% decrease). A compensatory increase in 
      the proportion of total spectral power in the theta (4-8Hz) and alpha (8-12Hz) 
      bands was seen, but otherwise normal sleep features were preserved. N3 sleep 
      decreased from 20±34 to 3±6min, otherwise there were no significant changes in 
      total sleep time, sleep efficiency, or other macrostructural sleep 
      characteristics. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: This novel SWS disruption 
      protocol produces specific reductions in delta band power similar to existing 
      methods, but has the advantage of being automated, such that SWS disruption can 
      be performed easily in a highly standardized and operator-independent manner. 
      CONCLUSION: This automated SWS disruption protocol effectively reduces SWS 
      without impacting overall sleep architecture.

TI  - Localized component filtering for electroencephalogram artifact rejection.
PG  - 608-619
LID - 10.1111/psyp.12810 [doi]
AB  - Blind source separation (BSS) based artifact rejection systems have been 
      extensively studied in the electroencephalogram (EEG) literature. Although there 
      have been advances in the development of techniques capable of dissociating 
      neural and artifactual activity, these are still not perfect. As a result, a 
      compromise between reduction of noise and leakage of neural activity has to be 
      found. Here, we propose a new methodology to enhance the performance of existing 
      BSS systems: Localized component filtering (LCF). In essence, LCF identifies the 
      artifactual time segments within each component extracted by BSS and restricts 
      the processing of components to these segments, therefore reducing neural 
      leakage. We show that LCF can substantially reduce the neural leakage, increasing 
      the true acceptance rate by 22 percentage points while worsening the false 
      acceptance rate by less than 2 percentage points in a dataset consisting of 
      simulated EEG data (4% improvement of the correlation between original and 
      cleaned signals). Evaluated on real EEG data, we observed a significant increase 
      of the signal-to-noise ratio of up to 9%.

TI  - Auditory steady state responses and cochlear implants: Modeling the 
      artifact-response mixture in the perspective of denoising.
PG  - e0174462
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0174462 [doi]
LID - e0174462
AB  - Auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in cochlear implant (CI) patients are 
      contaminated by the spread of a continuous CI electrical stimulation artifact. 
      The aim of this work was to model the electrophysiological mixture of the CI 
      artifact and the corresponding evoked potentials on scalp electrodes in order to 
      evaluate the performance of denoising algorithms in eliminating the CI artifact 
      in a controlled environment. The basis of the proposed computational framework is 
      a neural mass model representing the nodes of the auditory pathways. Six main 
      contributors to auditory evoked potentials from the cochlear level and up to the 
      auditory cortex were taken into consideration. The simulated dynamics were then 
      projected into a 3-layer realistic head model. 32-channel scalp recordings of the 
      CI artifact-response were then generated by solving the electromagnetic forward 
      problem. As an application, the framework's simulated 32-channel datasets were 
      used to compare the performance of 4 commonly used Independent Component Analysis 
      (ICA) algorithms: infomax, extended infomax, jade and fastICA in eliminating the 
      CI artifact. As expected, two major components were detectable in the simulated 
      datasets, a low frequency component at the modulation frequency and a pulsatile 
      high frequency component related to the stimulation frequency. The first can be 
      attributed to the phase-locked ASSR and the second to the stimulation artifact. 
      Among the ICA algorithms tested, simulations showed that infomax was the most 
      efficient and reliable in denoising the CI artifact-response mixture. Denoising 
      algorithms can induce undesirable deformation of the signal of interest in real 
      CI patient recordings. The proposed framework is a valuable tool for evaluating 
      these algorithms in a controllable environment ahead of experimental or clinical 
      applications.

TI  - Beware: Recruitment of Muscle Activity by the EEG-Neurofeedback Trainings of High 
      Frequencies.
PG  - 119

LID - 119
AB  - EEG-neurofeedback (NFB) became a very popular method aimed at improving cognitive 
      and behavioral performance. However, the EMG frequency spectrum overlies the 
      higher EEG oscillations and the NFB trainings focusing on these frequencies is 
      hindered by the problem of EMG load in the information fed back to the subjects. 
      In such a complex signal, it is highly probable that the most controllable 
      component will form the basis for operant conditioning. This might cause 
      different effects in the case of various training protocols and therefore needs 
      to be carefully assessed before designing training protocols and algorithms. In 
      the current experiment a group of healthy adults (n = 14) was trained by 
      professional trainers to up-regulate their beta1 (15-22 Hz) band for eight 
      sessions. The control group (n = 18) underwent the same training regime but 
      without rewards for increasing beta. In half of the participants trained to 
      up-regulate beta1 band (n = 7) a systematic increase in tonic EMG activity was 
      identified offline, implying that muscle activity became a foundation for 
      reinforcement in the trainings. The remaining participants did not present any 
      specific increase of the trained beta1 band amplitude. The training was perceived 
      effective by both trainers and the trainees in all groups. These results indicate 
      the necessity of proper control of muscle activity as a requirement for the 
      genuine EEG-NFB training, especially in protocols that do not aim at the 
      participants' relaxation. The specificity of the information fed back to the 
      participants should be of highest interest to all therapists and researchers, as 
      it might irreversibly alter the results of the training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attentional disorders (ADD) feature decreased attention span, 
      impulsivity, and over-activity interfering with successful lives. Childhood onset 
      ADD frequently persists to adulthood. Etiology may be hereditary or disease 
      associated. Prevalence is 5% but recognition may be 'overshadowed' by 
      comorbidities (brain injury, mood disorder) thereby escaping formal recognition. 
      Blinded diagnosis by MRI has failed. ADD may not itself manifest a single 
      anatomical pattern of brain abnormality but may reflect multiple, unique 
      responses to numerous and diverse etiologies. Alternatively, a stable 
      ADD-specific brain pattern may be better detected by brain physiology. EEG 
      coherence, measuring cortical connectivity, is used to explore this possibility. 
      METHODS: Participants: Ages 2 to 22 years; 347 ADD and 619 neurotypical controls 
      (CON). Following artifact reduction, principal components analysis (PCA) 
      identifies coherence factors with unique loading patterns. Discriminant function 
      analysis (DFA) determines discrimination success differentiating ADD from 
      CON. Split-half and jackknife analyses estimate prospective diagnostic success. 
      Coherence factor loading constitutes an ADD-specific pattern or 'connectome'.  
      RESULTS: PCA identified 40 factors explaining 50% of total variance. DFA on CON 
      versus ADD groups utilizing all factors was highly significant (p≤0.0001). ADD 
      subjects were separated into medication and comorbidity subgroups. DFA (stepping 
      allowed) based on CON versus ADD without comorbidities or medication treatment 
      successfully classified the correspondingly held out ADD subjects in every 
      instance. Ten randomly generated split-half replications of the entire population 
      demonstrated high-average classification success for each of the left out 
      test-sets (overall: CON, 83.65%; ADD, 90.07%). Higher success was obtained with 
      more restricted age sub-samples using jackknifing: 2-8 year olds (CON, 90.0%; 
      ADD, 90.6%); 8-14 year olds (CON, 96.8%; ADD 95.9%); and 14-20 year-olds (CON, 
      100.0%; ADD, 97.1%). The connectome manifested decreased and increased coherence. 
      Patterns were complex and bi-hemispheric; typically reported front-back and 
      left-right loading patterns were not observed. Subtemporal electrodes (seldom 
      utilized) were prominently involved.  CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate a stable 
      coherence connectome differentiating ADD from CON subjects including subgroups 
      with and without comorbidities and/or medications. This functional 'connectome', 
      constitutes a diagnostic ADD phenotype. Split-half replications support potential 
      for EEG-based ADD diagnosis, with increased accuracy using limited age ranges. 
      Repeated studies could assist recognition of physiological change from 
      interventions (pharmacological, behavioral).

TI  - Feasibility of magnetoencephalographic source imaging in patients with thalamic 
      deep brain stimulation for epilepsy.

AB  - Source localization of interictal spikes in patients with medically refractory 
      epilepsy is the most common clinical application of magnetoencephalography (MEG). 
      In recent decades, many patients with intractable epilepsy have been treated with 
      various forms of neurostimulation, including thalamic deep brain stimulation 
      (DBS). Patients with suboptimal seizure control after DBS might in some cases 
      benefit from further investigations for resective epilepsy surgery, including MEG 
      source imaging (MSI). We sought to determine the feasibility and accuracy of MSI 
      in the setting of active thalamic DBS. Simultaneous EEG/MEG was obtained in a 
      patient using an Elekta 306-channel MEG system, with high-frequency (100 Hz) DBS 
      of the thalamic anterior nuclei cycling between on and off states. Magnetic 
      artifacts associated with the DBS apparatus were successfully suppressed using 
      the spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) method. Electrical stimulation 
      artifact was removed by standard digital low-pass filtering. Dipole source 
      modeling results for spike foci in frontal and posterior temporal regions were 
      comparable between stimulation on and stimulation off states, and the source 
      solutions corresponded well to the localization of spikes documented by 
      intracranial EEG. MSI is thus feasible and source solutions can be accurate when 
      performed in patients with active thalamic DBS for epilepsy.

      expectations and a conditioning pain stimulus.

LID - S0165-0270(17)30004-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.01.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The locus coeruleus (LC) signals salience to sensory stimuli and 
      these responses can modulate the experience of pain stimuli. The pupil dilation 
      response (PDR) to noxious stimuli is thought to be a surrogate for LC responses, 
      but PDR response to Peltier-controlled noxious heat stimuli, the most commonly 
      used method in experimental pain research, has not been described. NEW METHOD: 
      Healthy volunteers were presented with randomly presented heat stimuli of 5 sec 
      duration and provided pain intensity ratings to each stimulus. Pupillometry was 
      performed and a method developed to quantify the PDR relevant to these stimuli. 
      The stimulus response, reliability, and effect of commonly used manipulations on 
      pain experience were explored. RESULTS: A method of artifact removal and 
      adjusting for lag from stimulus initiation to PDR response was developed, 
      resulting in a close correlation between pain intensity rating and PDR across a 
      large range of heat stimuli. A reliable assessment of PDR within an individual 
      was achieved with fewer presentations as heat stimulus intensity increased. The 
      correlation between pain rating and PDR was disrupted when cognitive load is 
      increased by manipulating expectations or presenting a second pain stimulus. 
      COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The PDR began later after skin heating than 
      electrical stimuli and this is the first examination of the PDR using standard 
      nociceptive testing and manipulations of expectations and competing noxious 
      stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: A method is described applying PDR to standard heat 
      nociceptive testing, demonstrating stimulus response, reliability, and disruption 
      by cognitive manipulation.

TI  - Variability of ICA decomposition may impact EEG signals when used to remove 
      eyeblink artifacts.
PG  - 386-398
LID - 10.1111/psyp.12804 [doi]
AB  - Despite the growing use of independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms for 
      isolating and removing eyeblink-related activity from EEG data, we have limited 
      understanding of how variability associated with ICA uncertainty may be 
      influencing the reconstructed EEG signal after removing the eyeblink artifact 
      components. To characterize the magnitude of this ICA uncertainty and to 
      understand the extent to which it may influence findings within ERP and EEG 
      investigations, ICA decompositions of EEG data from 32 college-aged young adults 
      were repeated 30 times for three popular ICA algorithms. Following each 
      decomposition, eyeblink components were identified and removed. The remaining 
      components were back-projected, and the resulting clean EEG data were further 
      used to analyze ERPs. Findings revealed that ICA uncertainty results in variation 
      in P3 amplitude as well as variation across all EEG sampling points, but differs 
      across ICA algorithms as a function of the spatial location of the EEG channel. 
      This investigation highlights the potential of ICA uncertainty to introduce 
      additional sources of variance when the data are back-projected without artifact 
      components. Careful selection of ICA algorithms and parameters can reduce the 
      extent to which ICA uncertainty may introduce an additional source of variance 
      within ERP/EEG studies.

      study examines the value of using non-task stimulation-induced EEG oscillations 
      to predict cognitive status in a birth cohort of healthy Danish males 
      (Metropolit) with varying cognitive ability. In particular, we examine the 
      steady-state VEP power response (SSVEP-PR) in the alpha (8Hz) and gamma (36Hz) 
      bands in 54 males (avg. age: 62.0 years) and compare these with 10 young healthy 
      participants (avg. age 27.6 years). Furthermore, we correlate the individual 
      alpha-to-gamma difference in relative visual-area power (ΔRV) with cognitive 
      scores for the older adults. We find that ΔRV decrease with age by just over one 
      standard deviation when comparing young with old participants (p<0.01). 
      Furthermore, intelligence is significantly negatively correlated with ΔRV in the 
      older adult cohort, even when processing speed, global cognition, executive 
      function, memory, and education (p<0.05). In our preferred specification, an 
      increase in ΔRV of one standard deviation is associated with a reduction in 
      intelligence of 48% of a standard deviation (p<0.01). Finally, we conclude that 
      the difference in cerebral rhythmic activity between the alpha and gamma bands is 
      associated with age and cognitive status, and that ΔRV therefore provide a 
      non-subjective clinical tool with which to examine cognitive status in old age.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the ability of the BOLD response to EEG spikes to assess the 
      epileptogenicity of the lesion in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). 
      Method: Patients with focal epilepsy and FCD who underwent 3T EEG-fMRI from 2006 
      to 2010 were included. Diagnosis of FCD was based on neuroradiology (MRI+), or 
      histopathology in MRI-negative cases (MRI-). Patients underwent 120 min EEG-fMRI 
      recording session. Spikes similar to those recorded outside the scanner were 
      marked in the filtered EEG. The lesion (in MRI+) or the removed cortex (in MRI-) 
      was marked on the anatomical T1 sequence, blindly to the BOLD response, after 
      reviewing the FLAIR images. For each BOLD response we assessed the concordance 
      with the spike field and with the lesion in MRI+ or the removed cortex in MRI-. 
      BOLD responses were considered "concordant" if the maximal t-value was inside the 
      marking. Follow-up after resection was used as gold-standard. Results: Twenty 
      patients were included (13 MRI+, 7 MRI-), but in seven the EEG was not active or 
      there were artifacts during acquisition. In all 13 studied patients, at least one 
      BOLD response was concordant with the spike field; in 9/13 (69%) at least one 
      BOLD response was concordant with the lesion: in 6/7 (86%) MRI+ and in 3/6 (50%) 
      MRI- patients. Conclusions: Our study shows a high level of concordance between 
      FCD and BOLD response. This data could provide useful information especially for 
      MRI negative patients. Moreover, it shows in almost all FCD patients, a metabolic 
      involvement of remote cortical or subcortical structures, corroborating the 
      concept of epileptic network.

AB  - The concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation with 
      electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is growing in popularity as a method for 
      assessing various cortical properties such as excitability, oscillations and 
      connectivity. However, this combination of methods is technically challenging, 
      resulting in artifacts both during recording and following typical EEG analysis 
      methods, which can distort the underlying neural signal. In this article, we 
      review the causes of artifacts in EEG recordings resulting from TMS, as well as 
      artifacts introduced during analysis (e.g. as the result of filtering over 
      high-frequency, large amplitude artifacts). We then discuss methods for removing 
      artifacts, and ways of designing pipelines to minimise analysis-related 
      artifacts. Finally, we introduce the TMS-EEG signal analyser (TESA), an 
      open-source extension for EEGLAB, which includes functions that are specific for 
      TMS-EEG analysis, such as removing and interpolating the TMS pulse artifact, 
      removing and minimising TMS-evoked muscle activity, and analysing TMS-evoked 
      potentials. The aims of TESA are to provide users with easy access to current 
      TMS-EEG analysis methods and to encourage direct comparisons of these methods and 
      pipelines. It is hoped that providing open-source functions will aid in both 
      improving and standardising analysis across the field of TMS-EEG research.

AB  - Resting-state networks have become an important tool for the study of brain 
      function. An ultra-fast imaging technique that allows to measure brain function, 
      called Magnetic Resonance Encephalography (MREG), achieves an order of magnitude 
      higher temporal resolution than standard echo-planar imaging (EPI). This new 
      sequence helps to correct physiological artifacts and improves the sensitivity of 
      the fMRI analysis. In this study, EPI is compared with MREG in terms of 
      capability to extract resting-state networks. Healthy controls underwent two 
      consecutive resting-state scans, one with EPI and the other with MREG. 
      Subject-level independent component analyses (ICA) were performed separately for 
      each of the two datasets. Using Stanford FIND atlas parcels as network templates, 
      the presence of ICA maps corresponding to each network was quantified in each 
      subject. The number of detected individual networks was significantly higher in 
      the MREG data set than for EPI. Moreover, using short time segments of MREG data, 
      such as 50 seconds, one can still detect and track consistent networks. Fast fMRI 
      thus results in an increased capability to extract distinct functional regions at 
      the individual subject level for the same scan times, and also allow the 
      extraction of consistent networks within shorter time intervals than when using 
      EPI, which is notably relevant for the analysis of dynamic functional 
      connectivity fluctuations. Hum Brain Mapp 38:817-830, 2017. © 2016 Wiley

AB  - Despite decades of research, effects of different types of meditation on 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) activity are still being defined. We compared 
      practitioners of three different meditation traditions (Vipassana, Himalayan Yoga 
      and Isha Shoonya) with a control group during a meditative and instructed 
      mind-wandering (IMW) block. All meditators showed higher parieto-occipital 60-110 
      Hz gamma amplitude than control subjects as a trait effect observed during 
      meditation and when considering meditation and IMW periods together. Moreover, 
      this gamma power was positively correlated with participants meditation 
      experience. Independent component analysis was used to show that gamma activity 
      did not originate in eye or muscle artifacts. In addition, we observed higher 
      7-11 Hz alpha activity in the Vipassana group compared to all the other groups 
      during both meditation and instructed mind wandering and lower 10-11 Hz activity 
      in the Himalayan yoga group during meditation only. We showed that meditation 
      practice is correlated to changes in the EEG gamma frequency range that are 
      common to a variety of meditation practices.

      contamination of ictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), and validate this method 
      on the basis of its performance in comparison to a commercially available 
      software method (AR1) to accurately depict seizure-onset location. Methods: A 
      blinded investigation used 23 EEG recordings of seizures from 8 patients. Each 
      recording was uninterpretable with digital filtering because of muscle artifact 
      and processed using AR1 and AR2 and reviewed by 26 EEG specialists. EEG readers 
      assessed seizure-onset time, lateralization, and region, and specified confidence 
      for each determination. The two methods were validated on the basis of the number 
      of readers able to render assignments, confidence, the intra-class correlation 
      (ICC), and agreement with other clinical findings. Results: Among the 23 
      seizures, two-thirds of the readers were able to delineate seizure-onset time in 
      10 of 23 using AR1, and 15 of 23 using AR2 (p<0.01). Fewer readers could 
      lateralize seizure-onset (p<0.05). The confidence measures of the assignments 
      were low (probable-unlikely), but increased using AR2 (p<0.05). The ICC for 
      identifying the time of seizure-onset was 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI), 
      0.11-0.18) using AR1 and 0.26 (95% CI 0.21-0.30) using AR2.  The EEG 
      interpretations were often consistent with behavioral, neurophysiological, and 
      neuro-radiological findings, with left sided assignments correct in 95.9% (CI 
      85.7-98.9%, n=4) of cases using AR2, and 91.9% (77.0-97.5%) (n=4) of cases using 
      AR1. Conclusions: EEG artifact reduction methods for localizing seizure-onset 
      does not result in high rates of interpretability, reader confidence, and 
      inter-reader agreement. However, the assignments by groups of readers are often 
      congruent with other clinical data. Utilization of the AR2 software method may 
      improve the validity of ictal EEG artifact reduction.

AB  - Genetically encoded calcium indicators and optogenetic actuators can report and 
      manipulate the activity of specific neuronal populations. However, applying 
      imaging and optogenetics simultaneously has been difficult to establish in the 
      mammalian brain, even though combining the techniques would provide a powerful 
      approach to reveal the functional organization of neural circuits. Here, we 
      developed a technique based on patterned two-photon illumination to allow fast 
      scanless imaging of GCaMP6 signals in the intact mouse brain at the same time as 
      single-photon optogenetic inhibition with Archaerhodopsin. Using combined imaging 
      and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate that single and short bursts 
      of action potentials in pyramidal neurons can be detected in the scanless 
      modality at acquisition frequencies up to 1 kHz. Moreover, we demonstrate that 
      our system strongly reduces the artifacts in the fluorescence detection that are 
      induced by single-photon optogenetic illumination. Finally, we validated our 
      technique investigating the role of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in the 
      control of spontaneous cortical dynamics. Monitoring the activity of cellular 
      populations on a precise spatiotemporal scale while manipulating neuronal 
      activity with optogenetics provides a powerful tool to causally elucidate the 
      cellular mechanisms underlying circuit function in the intact mammalian brain.

TI  - Gaussian Elimination-Based Novel Canonical Correlation Analysis Method for EEG 
      Motion Artifact Removal.
PG  - 9674712

LID - 9674712
AB  - The motion generated at the capturing time of electro-encephalography (EEG) 
      signal leads to the artifacts, which may reduce the quality of obtained 
      information. Existing artifact removal methods use canonical correlation analysis 
      (CCA) for removing artifacts along with ensemble empirical mode decomposition 
      (EEMD) and wavelet transform (WT). A new approach is proposed to further analyse 
      and improve the filtering performance and reduce the filter computation time 
      under highly noisy environment. This new approach of CCA is based on Gaussian 
      elimination method which is used for calculating the correlation coefficients 
      using backslash operation and is designed for EEG signal motion artifact removal. 
      Gaussian elimination is used for solving linear equation to calculate Eigen 
      values which reduces the computation cost of the CCA method. This novel proposed 
      method is tested against currently available artifact removal techniques using 
      EEMD-CCA and wavelet transform. The performance is tested on synthetic and real 
      EEG signal data. The proposed artifact removal technique is evaluated using 
      efficiency matrices such as del signal to noise ratio (DSNR), lambda (λ), root 
      mean square error (RMSE), elapsed time, and ROC parameters. The results indicate 
      suitablity of the proposed algorithm for use as a supplement to algorithms 
      currently in use.

AB  - A novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) signal which consists of a motor imagery- (MI-) based online interactive 
      brain-controlled switch, "teeth clenching" state detector, and a steady-state 
      visual evoked potential- (SSVEP-) based BCI was proposed to provide 
      multidimensional BCI control. MI-based BCI was used as single-pole double throw 
      brain switch (SPDTBS). By combining the SPDTBS with 4-class SSEVP-based BCI, 
      movement of robotic arm was controlled in three-dimensional (3D) space. In 
      addition, muscle artifact (EMG) of "teeth clenching" condition recorded from EEG 
      signal was detected and employed as interrupter, which can initialize the 
      statement of SPDTBS. Real-time writing task was implemented to verify the 
      reliability of the proposed noninvasive hybrid EEG-EMG-BCI. Eight subjects 
      participated in this study and succeeded to manipulate a robotic arm in 3D space 
      to write some English letters. The mean decoding accuracy of writing task was 
      0.93 ± 0.03. Four subjects achieved the optimal criteria of writing the word "HI" 
      which is the minimum movement of robotic arm directions (15 steps). Other 
      subjects had needed to take from 2 to 4 additional steps to finish the whole 
      process. These results suggested that our proposed hybrid noninvasive EEG-EMG-BCI 
      was robust and efficient for real-time multidimensional robotic arm control.

TI  - The Benefit of Neuromuscular Blockade in Patients with Postanoxic Myoclonus 
      Otherwise Obscuring Continuous Electroencephalography (CEEG).
PG  - 2504058
LID - 10.1155/2017/2504058 [doi]
LID - 2504058
AB  - Introduction. Myoclonus status epilepticus is independently associated with poor 
      outcome in coma patients after cardiac arrest. Determining if myoclonus is of 
      cortical origin on continuous electroencephalography (CEEG) can be difficult 
      secondary to the muscle artifact obscuring the underlying CEEG. The use of a 
      neuromuscular blocker can be useful in these cases. Methods. Retrospective review 
      of CEEG in patients with postanoxic myoclonus who received cisatracurium while 
      being monitored. Results. Twelve patients (mean age: 53.3 years; 58.3% male) met 
      inclusion criteria of clinical postanoxic myoclonus. The initial CEEG patterns 
      immediately prior to neuromuscular blockade showed myoclonic artifact with 
      continuous slowing (50%), burst suppression with myoclonic artifact (41.7%), and 
      continuous myogenic artifact obscuring CEEG (8.3%). After intravenous 
      administration of cisatracurium (0.1 mg-2 mg), reduction in artifact improved 
      quality of CEEG recordings in 9/12 (75%), revealing previously unrecognized 
      patterns: continuous EEG seizures (33.3%), lateralizing slowing (16.7%), burst 
      suppression (16.7%), generalized periodic discharges (8.3%), and, in the patient 
      who had an initially uninterpretable CEEG from myogenic artifact, continuous 
      slowing. Conclusion. Short-acting neuromuscular blockade is useful in determining 
      background cerebral activity on CEEG otherwise partially or completely obscured 
      by muscle artifact in patients with postanoxic myoclonus. Fully understanding 
      background cerebral activity is important in prognostication and treatment, 
      particularly when there are underlying EEG seizures.

AB  - EEG signals contain a large amount of ocular artifacts with different 
      time-frequency properties mixing together in EEGs of interest. The artifact 
      removal has been substantially dealt with by existing decomposition methods known 
      as PCA and ICA based on the orthogonality of signal vectors or statistical 
      independence of signal components. We focused on the signal morphology and 
      proposed a systematic decomposition method to identify the type of signal 
      components on the basis of sparsity in the time-frequency domain based on 
      Morphological Component Analysis (MCA), which provides a way of reconstruction 
      that guarantees accuracy in reconstruction by using multiple bases in accordance 
      with the concept of "dictionary." MCA was applied to decompose the real EEG 
      signal and clarified the best combination of dictionaries for this purpose. In 
      our proposed semirealistic biological signal analysis with iEEGs recorded from 
      the brain intracranially, those signals were successfully decomposed into 
      original types by a linear expansion of waveforms, such as redundant transforms: 
      UDWT, DCT, LDCT, DST, and DIRAC. Our result demonstrated that the most suitable 
      combination for EEG data analysis was UDWT, DST, and DIRAC to represent the 
      baseline envelope, multifrequency wave-forms, and spiking activities individually 
      as representative types of EEG morphologies.

AB  - Frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha asymmetry is widely researched in 
      studies of emotion, motivation, and psychopathology, yet it is a metric that has 
      been quantified and analyzed using diverse procedures, and diversity in 
      procedures muddles cross-study interpretation. The aim of this article is to 
      provide an updated tutorial for EEG alpha asymmetry recording, processing, 
      analysis, and interpretation, with an eye towards improving consistency of 
      results across studies. First, a brief background in alpha asymmetry findings is 
      provided. Then, some guidelines for recording, processing, and analyzing alpha 
      asymmetry are presented with an emphasis on the creation of asymmetry scores, 
      referencing choices, and artifact removal. Processing steps are explained in 
      detail, and references to MATLAB-based toolboxes that are helpful for creating 
      and investigating alpha asymmetry are noted. Then, conceptual challenges and 
      interpretative issues are reviewed, including a discussion of alpha asymmetry as 
      a mediator/moderator of emotion and psychopathology. Finally, the effects of two 
      automated component-based artifact correction algorithms-MARA and ADJUST-on 
      frontal alpha asymmetry are evaluated.

TI  - Intraoperative electrocorticography for physiological research in movement 
      disorders: principles and experience in 200 cases.
PG  - 122-131

AB  - OBJECTIVE Contemporary theories of the pathophysiology of movement disorders 
      emphasize abnormal oscillatory activity in basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops, 
      but these have been studied in humans mainly using depth recordings. Recording 
      from the surface of the cortex using electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a much 
      higher amplitude signal than depth recordings, is less susceptible to deep brain 
      stimulation (DBS) artifacts, and yields a surrogate measure of population spiking 
      via "broadband gamma" (50-200 Hz) activity. Therefore, a technical approach to 
      movement disorders surgery was developed that employs intraoperative ECoG as a 
      research tool. METHODS One hundred eighty-eight patients undergoing DBS for the 
      treatment of movement disorders were studied under an institutional review 
      board-approved protocol. Through the standard bur hole exposure that is 
      clinically indicated for DBS lead insertion, a strip electrode (6 or 28 contacts) 
      was inserted to cover the primary motor or prefrontal cortical areas. 
      Localization was confirmed by the reversal of the somatosensory evoked potential 
      and intraoperative CT or 2D fluoroscopy. The ECoG potentials were recorded at 
      rest and during a variety of tasks and analyzed offline in the frequency domain, 
      focusing on activity between 3 and 200 Hz. Strips were removed prior to closure. 
      Postoperative MRI was inspected for edema, signal change, or hematoma that could 
      be related to the placement of the ECoG strip. RESULTS One hundred ninety-eight 
      (99%) strips were successfully placed. Two ECoG placements were aborted due to 
      resistance during the attempted passage of the electrode. Perioperative surgical 
      complications occurred in 8 patients, including 5 hardware infections, 1 delayed 
      chronic subdural hematoma requiring evacuation, 1 intraparenchymal hematoma, and 
      1 venous infarction distant from the site of the recording. None of these 
      appeared to be directly related to the use of ECoG. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative 
      ECoG has long been used in neurosurgery for functional mapping and localization 
      of seizure foci. As applied during DBS surgery, it has become an important 
      research tool for understanding the brain networks in movement disorders and the 
      mechanisms of therapeutic stimulation. In experienced hands, the technique 
      appears to add minimal risk to surgery.

TI  - A Penalized Semialgebraic Deflation ICA Algorithm for the Efficient Extraction of 
      Interictal Epileptic Signals.
PG  - 94-104
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2504126 [doi]
AB  - As a noninvasive technique, electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to 
      monitor the brain signals of patients with epilepsy such as the interictal 
      epileptic spikes. However, the recorded data are often corrupted by artifacts 
      originating, for example, from muscle activities, which may have much higher 
      amplitudes than the interictal epileptic signals of interest. To remove these 
      artifacts, a number of independent component analysis (ICA) techniques were 
      successfully applied. In this paper, we propose a new deflation ICA algorithm, 
      called penalized semialgebraic unitary deflation (P-SAUD) algorithm, that 
      improves upon classical ICA methods by leading to a considerably reduced 
      computational complexity at equivalent performance. This is achieved by employing 
      a penalized semialgebraic extraction scheme, which permits us to identify the 
      epileptic components of interest (interictal spikes) first and obviates the need 
      of extracting subsequent components. The proposed method is evaluated on 
      physiologically plausible simulated EEG data and actual measurements of three 
      patients. The results are compared to those of several popular ICA algorithms as 
      well as second-order blind source separation methods, demonstrating that P-SAUD 
      extracts the epileptic spikes with the same accuracy as the best ICA methods, but 
      reduces the computational complexity by a factor of 10 for 32-channel recordings. 
      This superior computational efficiency is of particular interest considering the 
      increasing use of high-resolution EEG recordings, whose analysis requires 
      algorithms with low computational cost.

TI  - Applying dynamic data collection to improve dry electrode system performance for 
      a P300-based brain-computer interface.
PG  - 066018
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dry electrodes have an advantage over gel-based 'wet' electrodes by 
      providing quicker set-up time for electroencephalography recording; however, the 
      potentially poorer contact can result in noisier recordings. We examine the 
      impact that this may have on brain-computer interface communication and potential 
      approaches for mitigation. APPROACH: We present a performance comparison of wet 
      and dry electrodes for use with the P300 speller system in both healthy 
      participants and participants with communication disabilities (ALS and PLS), and 
      investigate the potential for a data-driven dynamic data collection algorithm to 
      compensate for the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dry systems. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Performance results from sixteen healthy participants obtained in the 
      standard static data collection environment demonstrate a substantial loss in 
      accuracy with the dry system. Using a dynamic stopping algorithm, performance may 
      have been improved by collecting more data in the dry system for ten healthy 
      participants and eight participants with communication disabilities; however, the 
      algorithm did not fully compensate for the lower SNR of the dry system. An 
      analysis of the wet and dry system recordings revealed that delta and theta 
      frequency band power (0.1-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz, respectively) are consistently higher 
      in dry system recordings across participants, indicating that transient and drift 
      artifacts may be an issue for dry systems. SIGNIFICANCE: Using dry electrodes is 
      desirable for reduced set-up time; however, this study demonstrates that online 
      performance is significantly poorer than for wet electrodes for users with and 
      without disabilities. We test a new application of dynamic stopping algorithms to 
      compensate for poorer SNR. Dynamic stopping improved dry system performance; 
      however, further signal processing efforts are likely necessary for full 
      mitigation.

      contamination by imaging (MR) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts. Artifact 
      correction of EEG data for real-time applications, such as neurofeedback studies, 
      is the subject of ongoing research. To date, average artifact subtraction (AAS) 
      is the most widespread real-time method used to partially remove BCG and imaging 
      artifacts without requiring extra hardware equipment; no alternative 
      software-only real time methods for removing EEG artifacts are available. NEW 
      METHODS: We introduce a novel, improved approach for real-time EEG artifact 
      correction during fMRI (rtICA). The rtICA is based on real time independent 
      component analysis (ICA) and it is employed following the AAS method. The rtICA 
      was implemented and validated during EEG and fMRI experiments on healthy 
      subjects. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that the rtICA employed after the 
      rtAAS can obtain 98.4% success in detection of eye blinks, 4.4 times larger INPS 
      reductions compared to RecView-corrected data, and effectively reduce motion 
      artifacts, as well as imaging and muscle artifacts, in real time on six healthy 
      subjects. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We compared our real-time artifact 
      reduction results with the rtAAS and various offline methods using multiple 
      evaluation metrics, including power analysis. Importantly, the rtICA does not 
      affect brain neuronal signals as reflected in EEG bands of interest, including 
      the alpha band. CONCLUSIONS: A novel real-time ICA method was proposed for 
      improving the EEG quality signal recorded during fMRI acquisition. The results 
      show substantial reduction of different types of artifacts using real-time ICA 
      method.

TI  - A new method to detect event-related potentials based on Pearson's correlation.
PG  - 11
LID - 11
AB  - Event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used in brain-computer interface 
      applications and in neuroscience.  Normal EEG activity is rich in background 
      noise, and therefore, in order to detect ERPs, it is usually necessary to take 
      the average from multiple trials to reduce the effects of this noise.  The noise 
      produced by EEG activity itself is not correlated with the ERP waveform and so, 
      by calculating the average, the noise is decreased by a factor inversely 
      proportional to the square root of N, where N is the number of averaged epochs. 
      This is the easiest strategy currently used to detect ERPs, which is based on 
      calculating the average of all ERP's waveform, these waveforms being time- and 
      phase-locked.  In this paper, a new method called GW6 is proposed, which 
      calculates the ERP using a mathematical method based only on Pearson's 
      correlation. The result is a graph with the same time resolution as the classical 
      ERP and which shows only positive peaks representing the increase-in consonance 
      with the stimuli-in EEG signal correlation over all channels.  This new method is 
      also useful for selectively identifying and highlighting some hidden components 
      of the ERP response that are not phase-locked, and that are usually hidden in the 
      standard and simple method based on the averaging of all the epochs.  These 
      hidden components seem to be caused by variations (between each successive 
      stimulus) of the ERP's inherent phase latency period (jitter), although the same 
      stimulus across all EEG channels produces a reasonably constant phase. For this 
      reason, this new method could be very helpful to investigate these hidden 
      components of the ERP response and to develop applications for scientific and 
      medical purposes. Moreover, this new method is more resistant to EEG artifacts 
      than the standard calculations of the average and could be very useful in 
      research and neurology.  The method we are proposing can be directly used in the 
      form of a process written in the well-known Matlab programming language and can 
      be easily and quickly written in any other software language.

TI  - The feasibility of using Microsoft Kinect v2 sensors during radiotherapy 
      delivery.
PG  - 446-453
LID - 10.1120/jacmp.v17i6.6377 [doi]
AB  - Consumer-grade distance sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect devices (v1 and 
      v2), have been investigated for use as marker-free motion monitoring systems for 
      radiotherapy. The radiotherapy delivery environment is challenging for such 
      sen-sors because of the proximity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) from the 
      pulse forming network which fires the magnetron and electron gun of a linear 
      accelerator (linac) during radiation delivery, as well as the requirement to 
      operate them from the control area. This work investigated whether using Kinect 
      v2 sensors as motion monitors was feasible during radiation delivery. Three 
      sensors were used each with a 12 m USB 3.0 active cable which replaced the 
      supplied 3 m USB 3.0 cable. Distance output data from the Kinect v2 sensors was 
      recorded under four condi-tions of linac operation: (i) powered up only, (ii) 
      pulse forming network operating with no radiation, (iii) pulse repetition 
      frequency varied between 6 Hz and 400 Hz, (iv) dose rate varied between 50 and 
      1450 monitor units (MU) per minute. A solid water block was used as an object and 
      imaged when static, moved in a set of steps from 0.6 m to 2.0 m from the sensor 
      and moving dynamically in two sinusoidal-like trajectories. Few additional image 
      artifacts were observed and there was no impact on the tracking of the motion 
      patterns (root mean squared accuracy of 1.4 and 1.1mm, respectively). The 
      sensors' distance accuracy varied by 2.0 to 3.8 mm (1.2 to 1.4 mm post distance 
      calibration) across the range measured; the precision was 1 mm. There was minimal 
      effect from the EMI on the distance calibration data: 0 mm or 1 mm reported 
      distance change (2 mm maximum change at one position). Kinect v2 sensors operated 
      with 12 m USB 3.0 active cables appear robust to the radiotherapy treatment 
      environment.

TI  - Smart Helmet: Wearable Multichannel ECG and EEG.
PG  - 2700111
LID - 2700111
AB  - Modern wearable technologies have enabled continuous recording of vital signs, 
      however, for activities such as cycling, motor-racing, or military engagement, a 
      helmet with embedded sensors would provide maximum convenience and the 
      opportunity to monitor simultaneously both the vital signs and the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG). To this end, we investigate the feasibility of 
      recording the electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, and EEG from face-lead 
      locations, by embedding multiple electrodes within a standard helmet. The 
      electrode positions are at the lower jaw, mastoids, and forehead, while for 
      validation purposes a respiration belt around the thorax and a reference ECG from 
      the chest serve as ground truth to assess the performance. The within-helmet EEG 
      is verified by exposing the subjects to periodic visual and auditory stimuli and 
      screening the recordings for the steady-state evoked potentials in response to 
      these stimuli. Cycling and walking are chosen as real-world activities to 
      illustrate how to deal with the so-induced irregular motion artifacts, which 
      contaminate the recordings. We also propose a multivariate R-peak detection 
      algorithm suitable for such noisy environments. Recordings in real-world 
      scenarios support a proof of concept of the feasibility of recording vital signs 
      and EEG from the proposed smart helmet.

TI  - A Cross-Correlational Analysis between Electroencephalographic and End-Tidal 
      Carbon Dioxide Signals: Methodological Issues in the Presence of Missing Data and 
      Real Data Results.
LID - 1828
AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) irreducible artifacts are common and the removal of 
      corrupted segments from the analysis may be required. The present study aims at 
      exploring the effects of different EEG Missing Data Segment (MDS) distributions 
      on cross-correlation analysis, involving EEG and physiological signals. The 
      reliability of cross-correlation analysis both at single subject and at group 
      level as a function of missing data statistics was evaluated using dedicated 
      simulations. Moreover, a Bayesian-based approach for combining the single subject 
      results at group level by considering each subject's reliability was introduced. 
      Starting from the above considerations, the cross-correlation function between 
      EEG Global Field Power (GFP) in delta band and end-tidal CO₂ (P(ET)CO₂) during 
      rest and voluntary breath-hold was evaluated in six healthy subjects. The 
      analysis of simulated data results at single subject level revealed a worsening 
      of precision and accuracy in the cross-correlation analysis in the presence of 
      MDS. At the group level, a large improvement in the results' reliability with 
      respect to single subject analysis was observed. The proposed Bayesian approach 
      showed a slight improvement with respect to simple average results. Real data 
      results were discussed in light of the simulated data tests and of the current 
      physiological findings.

TI  - Flicker Regularity Is Crucial for Entrainment of Alpha Oscillations.
PG  - 503
LID - 503
AB  - Previous studies have shown that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in human 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) modulate perception via phase-dependent inhibition. If 
      entrained to an external driving force, inhibition maxima and minima of the 
      oscillation appear more distinct in time and make potential phase-dependent 
      perception predictable. There is an ongoing debate about whether visual 
      stimulation is suitable to entrain alpha oscillations. On the one hand, it has 
      been argued that a series of light flashes results in transient event-related 
      responses (ERPs) superimposed on the ongoing EEG. On the other hand, it has been 
      demonstrated that alpha oscillations become entrained to a series of light 
      flashes if they are presented at a certain temporal regularity. This raises the 
      question under which circumstances a sequence of light flashes causes 
      entrainment, i.e., whether an arrhythmic stream of light flashes would also 
      result in entrainment. Here, we measured detection rates in response to visual 
      targets at two opposing stimulation phases during rhythmic and arrhythmic light 
      stimulation. We introduce a new measure called "behavioral modulation depth" to 
      determine differences in perception. This measure is capable of correcting for 
      inevitable artifacts that occur in visual detection tasks during visual 
      stimulation. The physical concept of entrainment predicts that increased 
      stimulation intensity should produce stronger entrainment. Thus, two experiments 
      with medium (Experiment 1) and high (Experiment 2) stimulation intensity were 
      performed. Data from the first experiment show that the behavioral modulation 
      depth (alpha phase-dependent differences in detection threshold) increases with 
      increasing entrainment of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, individual alpha phase 
      delays of entrained alpha oscillations determine the behavioral modulation depth: 
      the largest behavioral modulation depth can be found if targets presented during 
      the minimum of the entrained oscillation are compared to those presented during 
      the maximum. In the second experiment stimulation with higher light intensity 
      during both rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation lead to an increased behavioral 
      modulation depth, supposedly as a consequence of stronger entrainment during 
      rhythmic stimulation. Altogether, our results reveal evidence for rhythmic and 
      arrhythmic visual stimulation to induce fundamentally different processes in the 
      brain: we suggest that rhythmic but not arrhythmic stimulation interacts with 
      ongoing alpha oscillations via entrainment.

TI  - TMSEEG: A MATLAB-Based Graphical User Interface for Processing 
      Electrophysiological Signals during Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
PG  - 78
LID - 78
AB  - Concurrent recording of electroencephalography (EEG) during transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS) is an emerging and powerful tool for studying brain health and 
      function. Despite a growing interest in adaptation of TMS-EEG across neuroscience 
      disciplines, its widespread utility is limited by signal processing challenges. 
      These challenges arise due to the nature of TMS and the sensitivity of EEG to 
      artifacts that often mask TMS-evoked potentials (TEP)s. With an increase in the 
      complexity of data processing methods and a growing interest in multi-site data 
      integration, analysis of TMS-EEG data requires the development of a standardized 
      method to recover TEPs from various sources of artifacts. This article introduces 
      TMSEEG, an open-source MATLAB application comprised of multiple algorithms 
      organized to facilitate a step-by-step procedure for TMS-EEG signal processing. 
      Using a modular design and interactive graphical user interface (GUI), this 
      toolbox aims to streamline TMS-EEG signal processing for both novice and 
      experienced users. Specifically, TMSEEG provides: (i) targeted removal of 
      TMS-induced and general EEG artifacts; (ii) a step-by-step modular workflow with 
      flexibility to modify existing algorithms and add customized algorithms; (iii) a 
      comprehensive display and quantification of artifacts; (iv) quality control check 
      points with visual feedback of TEPs throughout the data processing workflow; and 
      (v) capability to label and store a database of artifacts. In addition to these 
      features, the software architecture of TMSEEG ensures minimal user effort in 
      initial setup and configuration of parameters for each processing step. This is 
      partly accomplished through a close integration with EEGLAB, a widely used 
      open-source toolbox for EEG signal processing. In this article, we introduce 
      TMSEEG, validate its features and demonstrate its application in extracting TEPs 
      across several single- and multi-pulse TMS protocols. As the first open-source 
      GUI-based pipeline for TMS-EEG signal processing, this toolbox intends to promote 
      the widespread utility and standardization of an emerging technology in brain 
      research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate knowledge about the positions of electrodes in 
      electroencephalography (EEG) is very important for precise source localizations. 
      Direct detection of electrodes from magnetic resonance (MR) images is 
      particularly interesting, as it is possible to avoid errors of co-registration 
      between electrode and head coordinate systems. In this study, we propose an 
      automated MR-based method for electrode detection and labeling, particularly 
      tailored to high-density montages. APPROACH: Anatomical MR images were processed 
      to create an electrode-enhanced image in individual space. Image processing 
      included intensity non-uniformity correction, background noise and goggles 
      artifact removal. Next, we defined a search volume around the head where 
      electrode positions were detected. Electrodes were identified as local maxima in 
      the search volume and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard 
      space using an affine transformation. This allowed the matching of the detected 
      points with the specific EEG montage template, as well as their labeling. 
      Matching and labeling were performed by the coherent point drift method. Our 
      method was assessed on 8 MR images collected in subjects wearing a 256-channel 
      EEG net, using the displacement with respect to manually selected electrodes as 
      performance metric. MAIN RESULTS: Average displacement achieved by our method was 
      significantly lower compared to alternative techniques, such as the 
      photogrammetry technique. The maximum displacement was for more than 99% of the 
      electrodes lower than 1 cm, which is typically considered an acceptable upper 
      limit for errors in electrode positioning. Our method showed robustness and 
      reliability, even in suboptimal conditions, such as in the case of net rotation, 
      imprecisely gathered wires, electrode detachment from the head, and MR image 
      ghosting. SIGNIFICANCE: We showed that our method provides objective, repeatable 
      and precise estimates of EEG electrode coordinates. We hope our work will 
      contribute to a more widespread use of high-density EEG as a brain-imaging tool.

TI  - Effects of Mental Load and Fatigue on Steady-State Evoked Potential Based Brain 
      Computer Interface Tasks: A Comparison of Periodic Flickering and Motion-Reversal 
      Based Visual Attention.
PG  - e0163426

LID - e0163426
AB  - Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) based paradigm is a conventional 
      BCI method with the advantages of high information transfer rate, high tolerance 
      to artifacts and the robust performance across users. But the occurrence of 
      mental load and fatigue when users stare at flickering stimuli is a critical 
      problem in implementation of SSVEP-based BCIs. Based on electroencephalography 
      (EEG) power indices α, θ, θ + α, ratio index θ/α and response properties of 
      amplitude and SNR, this study quantitatively evaluated the mental load and 
      fatigue in both of conventional flickering and the novel motion-reversal visual 
      attention tasks. Results over nine subjects revealed significant mental load 
      alleviation in motion-reversal task rather than flickering task. The interaction 
      between factors of "stimulation type" and "fatigue level" also illustrated the 
      motion-reversal stimulation as a superior anti-fatigue solution for long-term BCI 
      operation. Taken together, our work provided an objective method favorable for 
      the design of more practically applicable steady-state evoked potential based 
      BCIs.

      techniques.
PG  - 1004-6
LID - 10.1016/j.dib.2016.06.032 [doi]
AB  - Artifact rejection techniques are used to recover the brain signals underlying 
      artifactual electroencephalographic (EEG) segments. Although over the last few 
      years many different artifact rejection techniques have been proposed 
      (http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2115236[1], 
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2006.09.003[2], 
      http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e16126553[3]), none has been established as a gold 
      standard so far, because assessing their performance is difficult and subjective 
      (http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2009.5394295[4], 
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2011.02.001[5], 
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89208-3_300. [6]). This limitation is mainly 
      based on the fact that the underlying artifact-free brain signal is unknown, so 
      there is no objective way to measure how close the retrieved signal is to the 
      real one. This article solves the aforementioned problem by presenting a 
      semi-simulated EEG dataset, where artifact-free EEG signals are manually 
      contaminated with ocular artifacts, using a realistic head model. The significant 
      part of this dataset is that it contains the pre-contamination EEG signals, so 
      the brain signals underlying the EOG artifacts are known and thus the performance 
      of every artifact rejection technique can be objectively assessed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often contaminated by the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) interference, which affects quantitative characterization 
      of EEG. NEW METHOD: We propose null-coherence, a frequency-based approach, to 
      attenuate the ECG interference in EEG using simultaneously recorded ECG as a 
      reference signal. After validating the proposed approach using numerically 
      simulated data, we apply this approach to EEG recorded from six newborns 
      receiving therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy. We compare our 
      approach with an independent component analysis (ICA), a previously proposed 
      approach to attenuate ECG artifacts in the EEG signal. The power spectrum and the 
      cortico-cortical connectivity of the ECG attenuated EEG was compared against the 
      power spectrum and the cortico-cortical connectivity of the raw EEG. RESULTS: The 
      null-coherence approach attenuated the ECG contamination without leaving any 
      residual of the ECG in the EEG. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: We show that the 
      null-coherence approach performs better than ICA in attenuating the ECG 
      contamination without enhancing cortico-cortical connectivity. CONCLUSION: Our 
      analysis suggests that using ICA to remove ECG contamination from the EEG suffers 
      from redistribution problems, whereas the null-coherence approach does not. We 
      show that both the null-coherence and ICA approaches attenuate the ECG 
      contamination. However, the EEG obtained after ICA cleaning displayed higher 
      cortico-cortical connectivity compared with that obtained using the 
      null-coherence approach. This suggests that null-coherence is superior to ICA in 
      attenuating the ECG interference in EEG for cortico-cortical connectivity 
      analysis.

AB  - The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is a multimodal technique extensively applied for 
      mapping the human brain. However, the quality of EEG data obtained within the MRI 
      environment is strongly affected by subject motion due to the induction of 
      voltages in addition to artefacts caused by the scanning gradients and the 
      heartbeat. This has limited its application in populations such as paediatric 
      patients or to study epileptic seizure onset. Recent work has used a Moiré-phase 
      grating and a MR-compatible camera to prospectively update image acquisition and 
      improve fMRI quality (prospective motion correction: PMC). In this study, we use 
      this technology to retrospectively reduce the spurious voltages induced by motion 
      in the EEG data acquired inside the MRI scanner, with and without fMRI 
      acquisitions. This was achieved by modelling induced voltages from the tracking 
      system motion parameters; position and angles, their first derivative 
      (velocities) and the velocity squared. This model was used to remove the voltages 
      related to the detected motion via a linear regression. Since EEG quality during 
      fMRI relies on a temporally stable gradient artefact (GA) template (calculated 
      from averaging EEG epochs matched to scan volume or slice acquisition), this was 
      evaluated in sessions both with and without motion contamination, and with and 
      without PMC. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of significantly 
      reducing motion-related artefact with a magnitude of up to 10mm of translation, 
      6° of rotation and velocities of 50mm/s, while preserving physiological 
      information. We also demonstrate that the EEG-GA variance is not increased by the 
      gradient direction changes associated with PMC. Provided a scan slice-based GA 
      template is used (rather than a scan volume GA template) we demonstrate that EEG 
      variance during motion can be supressed towards levels found when subjects are 
      still. In summary, we show that PMC can be used to dramatically improve EEG 
      quality during large amplitude movements, while benefiting from previously 
      reported improvements in fMRI quality, and does not affect EEG data quality in 
      the absence of large amplitude movements.

TI  - Circumferential optical coherence tomography angiography imaging of the swine 
      esophagus using a micromotor balloon catheter.
PG  - 2927-42
LID - 10.1364/BOE.7.002927 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate a micromotor balloon imaging catheter for ultrahigh speed 
      endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) which provides wide area, 
      circumferential structural and angiographic imaging of the esophagus without 
      contrast agents. Using a 1310 nm MEMS tunable wavelength swept VCSEL light 
      source, the system has a 1.2 MHz A-scan rate and ~8.5 µm axial resolution in 
      tissue. The micromotor balloon catheter enables circumferential imaging of the 
      esophagus at 240 frames per second (fps) with a ~30 µm (FWHM) spot size. 
      Volumetric imaging is achieved by proximal pullback of the micromotor assembly 
      within the balloon at 1.5 mm/sec. Volumetric data consisting of 4200 
      circumferential images of 5,000 A-scans each over a 2.6 cm length, covering a ~13 
      cm(2) area is acquired in <18 seconds. A non-rigid image registration algorithm 
      is used to suppress motion artifacts from non-uniform rotational distortion 
      (NURD), cardiac motion or respiration. En face OCT images at various depths can 
      be generated. OCT angiography (OCTA) is computed using intensity decorrelation 
      between sequential pairs of circumferential scans and enables three-dimensional 
      visualization of vasculature. Wide area volumetric OCT and OCTA imaging of the 
      swine esophagus in vivo is demonstrated.

TI  - Direction and viewing area-sensitive influence of EOG artifacts revealed in the 
      EEG topographic pattern analysis.
PG  - 301-14
LID - 10.1007/s11571-016-9382-4 [doi]
AB  - The influence of eye movement-related artifacts on electroencephalography (EEG) 
      signals of human subjects, who were requested to perform a direction or viewing 
      area dependent saccade task, was investigated by using a simultaneous recording 
      with ocular potentials as electro-oculography (EOG). In the past, EOG artifact 
      removals have been studied in tasks with a single fixation point in the screen 
      center, with less attention to the sensitivity of cornea-retinal dipole 
      orientations to the EEG head map. In the present study, we hypothesized the 
      existence of a systematic EOG influence that differs according to coupling 
      conditions of eye-movement directions with viewing areas including different 
      fixation points. The effect was validated in the linear regression analysis by 
      using 12 task conditions combining horizontal/vertical eye-movement direction and 
      three segregated zones of gaze in the screen. In the first place, event-related 
      potential topographic patterns were analyzed to compare the 12 conditions and 
      propagation coefficients of the linear regression analysis were successively 
      calculated in each condition. As a result, the EOG influences were significantly 
      different in a large number of EEG channels, especially in the case of horizontal 
      eye-movements. In the cross validation, the linear regression analysis using the 
      appropriate dataset of the target direction/viewing area combination demonstrated 
      an improved performance compared with the traditional methods using a single 
      fixation at the center. This result may open a potential way to improve artifact 
      correction methods by considering the systematic EOG influence that can be 
      predicted according to the view angle such as using eye-tracker systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Typical electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings often contain 
      substantial artifact. These artifacts, often large and intermittent, can 
      interfere with quantification of the EEG via its power spectrum. To reduce the 
      impact of artifact, EEG records are typically cleaned by a preprocessing stage 
      that removes individual segments or components of the recording. However, such 
      preprocessing can introduce bias, discard available signal, and be 
      labor-intensive. With this motivation, we present a method that uses robust 
      statistics to reduce dependence on preprocessing by minimizing the effect of 
      large intermittent outliers on the spectral estimates. NEW METHOD: Using the 
      multitaper method (Thomson, 1982) as a starting point, we replaced the final step 
      of the standard power spectrum calculation with a quantile-based estimator, and 
      the Jackknife approach to confidence intervals with a Bayesian approach. The 
      method is implemented in provided MATLAB modules, which extend the widely used 
      Chronux toolbox. RESULTS: Using both simulated and human data, we show that in 
      the presence of large intermittent outliers, the robust method produces improved 
      estimates of the power spectrum, and that the Bayesian confidence intervals yield 
      close-to-veridical coverage factors. COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHOD: The robust 
      method, as compared to the standard method, is less affected by artifact: 
      inclusion of outliers produces fewer changes in the shape of the power spectrum 
      as well as in the coverage factor. CONCLUSION: In the presence of large 
      intermittent outliers, the robust method can reduce dependence on data 
      preprocessing as compared to standard methods of spectral estimation.

TI  - An Electrocorticography Grid with Conductive Nanoparticles in a Polymer Thick 
      Film on an Organic Substrate Improves CT and MR Imaging.
PG  - 595-601

AB  - Purpose To develop an electrocorticography (ECoG) grid by using deposition of 
      conductive nanoparticles in a polymer thick film on an organic substrate (PTFOS) 
      that induces minimal, if any, artifacts on computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic 
      resonance (MR) images and is safe in terms of tissue reactivity and MR heating. 
      Materials and Methods All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use 
      Committee and complied with the Public Health Services Guide for the Care and Use 
      of Animals. Electrical functioning of PTFOS for cortical recording and 
      stimulation was tested in two mice. PTFOS disks were implanted in two mice; after 
      30 days, the tissues surrounding the implants were harvested, and tissue injury 
      was studied by using immunostaining. Five neurosurgeons rated mechanical 
      properties of PTFOS compared with conventional grids by using a three-level 
      Likert scale. Temperature increases during 30 minutes of 3-T MR imaging were 
      measured in a head phantom with no grid, a conventional grid, and a PTFOS grid. 
      Two neuroradiologists rated artifacts on CT and MR images of a cadaveric head 
      specimen with no grid, a conventional grid, and a PTFOS grid by using a 
      four-level Likert scale, and the mean ratings were compared between grids. 
      Results Oscillatory local field potentials were captured with cortical 
      recordings. Cortical stimulations in motor cortex elicited muscle contractions. 
      PTFOS implants caused no adverse tissue reaction. Mechanical properties were 
      rated superior to conventional grids (χ(2) test, P < .05). The temperature 
      increase during MR imaging for the three cases of no grid, PTFOS grid, and 
      conventional grid was 3.84°C, 4.05°C, and 10.13°C, respectively. PTFOS induced no 
      appreciable artifacts on CT and MR images, and PTFOS image quality was rated 
      significantly higher than that with conventional grids (two-tailed t test, P < 
      .05). Conclusion PTFOS grids may be an attractive alternative to conventional 
      ECoG grids with regard to mechanical properties, 3-T MR heating profile, and CT 
      and MR imaging artifacts. (©) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the modified electroconvulsive 
      therapy (MECT) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) of schizophrenia patients. A 
      total of 26 schizophrenia patients who received MECT were recruited. EEG 
      recording was initiated at 30 min before 1st and 6th MECT and terminated on the 
      2nd day. Images without artifacts were selected for the analysis of δ, θ, α1, α2 
      and β bands. The wave energy at each frequency, index of waves at different bands 
      from the same lead, index of waves at the same band from different leads, time of 
      epileptic discharge, time of resting state, and time to the stable EEG were 
      determined and compared. RESULTS: The energy of slow waves increased. α waves 
      reduced, but θ waves increased in the frontotemporal area. The index of θ waves 
      increased. After resting state, brainwaves first occurred in the frontal area. 
      Significant difference was observed in the time to waves returning to normal 
      (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After MECT, the θ waves in the same lead increases, and 
      its energy also elevates; α wave in the frontotemporal area reduces; there is 
      transient reduction in cerebral function during MECT. After electric resting 
      state, brainwaves mainly occur in the frontal area, and the time to brainwaves 
      returning to normal reduces over time after MECT.

TI  - Intracranial Cortical Calcifications in a Focal Epilepsy Patient with 
      Pseudohypoparathyroidism.
PG  - 31-5
LID - 10.14581/jer.16006 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic parathyroid dysfunction often have intracranial 
      calcification in deep gray matter (GM) and subcortical white matter (WM) of their 
      brain. Some of them are also epilepsy patients. Although cortical etiologies are 
      main cause of epileptic seizure, cortical calcification has not been reported in 
      these patients. We report a newly diagnosed focal epilepsy patient whose brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial calcifications in cortical as 
      well as subcortical areas. Blood lab revealed that he had hypocalcemia due to 
      pseudohypoparathyroidism. Video EEG monitoring revealed the ictal EEG mainly 
      consist of polymorphic delta to theta waves with maximum at right temporal area 
      followed by background attenuation and muscle artifacts. The interictal EEG 
      showed multiple focal spike-wave discharges. After given oral calcium and 
      calcitriol supplement, his calcium and phosphorous level normalized and he 
      remains seizure free. This is the first case to show cortical calcification in a 
      patient with pseudohypoparathyroidism. Cortical calcification could be an 
      important measure of seizure burden in these patients and thus sophisticated 
      imaging protocols should be used to visualize the extent of calcium deposits.

TI  - "Eyes Open - Eyes Closed" EEG/fMRI data set including dedicated "Carbon Wire 
      Loop" motion detection channels.
PG  - 990-994
AB  - This data set contains electroencephalography (EEG) data as well as simultaneous 
      EEG with functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) data. During EEG/fMRI, 
      the EEG cap was outfitted with a hardware-based add-on consisting of carbon-wire 
      loops (CWL). These yielded six extra׳CWL׳ signals related to Faraday induction of 
      these loops in the main magnetic field "Measurement and reduction of motion and 
      ballistocardiogram artefacts from simultaneous EEG and fMRI 
      recordings" (Masterton et al., 2007) [1]. In this data set, the CWL data make it 
      possible to do a direct regression approach to deal with the BCG and specifically 
      He artifact. The CWL-EEG/fMRI data in this paper has been recorded on two MRI 
      scanners with different Helium pump systems (4 subjects on a 3 T TIM Trio and 4 
      subjects on a 3T VERIO). Separate EEG/fMRI data sets have been recorded for the 
      helium pump ON as well as the helium pump OFF conditions. The EEG-only data (same 
      subjects) has been recorded for a motion artifact-free reference EEG signal 
      outside of the scanner. This paper also links to an EEGlab "EEGLAB: an open 
      source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent 
      component analysis" (Delorme and Makeig, 2004) [2] plugin to perform a CWL 
      regression approach to deal with the He pump artifact, as published in the main 
      paper "Carbon-wire loop based artifact correction outperforms post-processing 
      EEG/fMRI corrections-A validation of a real-time simultaneous EEG/fMRI correction 
      method" (van der Meer et al., 2016) [3].

TI  - Identifying Treatment Response of Sertraline in a Teenager with Selective Mutism 
      using Electrophysiological Neuroimaging.
PG  - 216-219
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective Mutism is described as the inability to verbally express 
      oneself in anxiety provoking social situations and may result in awkward social 
      interactions in school-aged children. In this case-report we present the baseline 
      electrophysiological neuroimaging results and after treatment with Sertraline for 
      6-weeks. METHODS: A 20-channel EEG event-related potential recording was acquired 
      during an internal voice task at baseline prior to the initiation of 50mg of 
      Sertraline and then repeated 6-weeks after treatment with Sertraline. EEG signals 
      were processed for movement, eye-blink, and muscle artifacts and ERP signal 
      averaging was completed. ERPs were analyzed using Standard Low Resolution Brain 
      Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA). RESULTS: At baseline, Sertraline increased 
      the neuronal activation in the middle temporal gyrus and the anterior cingulate 
      gyrus from baseline in the patient following 6-weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: 
      Our findings suggest that electrophysiological neuroimaging may provide a 
      creative approach for personalizing medicine by providing insight to the 
      pharmacodynamics of antidepressants.

TI  - Unmasking local activity within local field potentials (LFPs) by removing distal 
      electrical signals using independent component analysis.

AB  - Local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly thought to reflect the aggregate 
      dynamics in local neural circuits around recording electrodes. However, we show 
      that when LFPs are recorded in awake behaving animals against a distal reference 
      on the skull as commonly practiced, LFPs are significantly contaminated by 
      non-local and non-neural sources arising from the reference electrode and from 
      movement-related noise. In a data set with simultaneously recorded LFPs and 
      electroencephalograms (EEGs) across multiple brain regions while rats perform an 
      auditory oddball task, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify 
      signals arising from electrical reference and from volume-conducted noise based 
      on their distributed spatial pattern across multiple electrodes and distinct 
      power spectral features. These sources of distal electrical signals collectively 
      accounted for 23-77% of total variance in unprocessed LFPs, as well as most of 
      the gamma oscillation responses to the target stimulus in EEGs. Gamma oscillation 
      power was concentrated in volume-conducted noise and was tightly coupled with the 
      onset of licking behavior, suggesting a likely origin of muscle activity 
      associated with body movement or orofacial movement. The removal of distal signal 
      contamination also selectively reduced correlations of LFP/EEG signals between 
      distant brain regions but not within the same region. Finally, the removal of 
      contamination from distal electrical signals preserved an event-related potential 
      (ERP) response to auditory stimuli in the frontal cortex and also increased the 
      coupling between the frontal ERP amplitude and neuronal activity in the basal 
      forebrain, supporting the conclusion that removing distal electrical signals 
      unmasked local activity within LFPs. Together, these results highlight the 
      significant contamination of LFPs by distal electrical signals and caution 
      against the straightforward interpretation of unprocessed LFPs. Our results 
      provide a principled approach to identify and remove such contamination to unmask 
      local LFPs.

AB  - Recent advances in electroencephalographic (EEG) acquisition allow for recordings 
      using wet and dry sensors during whole-body motion. The large variety of 
      commercially available EEG systems contrasts with the lack of established methods 
      for objectively describing their performance during whole-body motion. Therefore, 
      the aim of this study was to introduce methods for benchmarking the suitability 
      of new EEG technologies for that context. Subjects performed an auditory oddball 
      task using three different EEG systems (Biosemi wet-BSM, Cognionics Wet-Cwet, 
      Conionics Dry-Cdry). Nine subjects performed the oddball task while seated and 
      walking on a treadmill. We calculated EEG epoch rejection rate, pre-stimulus 
      noise (PSN), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and EEG amplitude variance across the 
      P300 event window (CVERP) from a subset of 12 channels common to all systems. We 
      also calculated test-retest reliability and the subject's level of comfort while 
      using each system. Our results showed that using the traditional 75 μV rejection 
      threshold BSM and Cwet epoch rejection rates are ~25% and ~47% in the seated and 
      walking conditions respectively. However, this threshold rejects ~63% of epochs 
      for Cdry in the seated condition and excludes 100% of epochs for the majority of 
      subjects during walking. BSM showed predominantly no statistical differences 
      between seated and walking condition for all metrics, whereas Cwet showed 
      increases in PSN and CVERP, as well as reduced SNR in the walking condition. Data 
      quality from Cdry in seated conditions were predominantly inferior in comparison 
      to the wet systems. Test-retest reliability was mostly moderate/good for these 
      variables, especially in seated conditions. In addition, subjects felt less 
      discomfort and were motivated for longer recording periods while using wet EEG 
      systems in comparison to the dry system. The proposed method was successful in 
      identifying differences across systems that are mostly caused by motion-related 
      artifacts and usability issues. We conclude that the extraction of the selected 
      metrics from an auditory oddball paradigm may be used as a benchmark method for 
      testing the performance of different EEG systems in mobile conditions. Moreover 
      dry EEG systems may need substantial improvements to meet the quality standards 
      of wet electrodes.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a portable brain-imaging technique with the 
      advantage of high-temporal resolution that can be used to record electrical 
      activity of the brain. However, it is difficult to analyze EEG signals due to the 
      contamination of ocular artifacts, and which potentially results in misleading 
      conclusions. Also, it is a proven fact that the contamination of ocular artifacts 
      cause to reduce the classification accuracy of a brain-computer interface (BCI). 
      It is therefore very important to remove/reduce these artifacts before the 
      analysis of EEG signals for applications like BCI. In this paper, a hybrid 
      framework that combines independent component analysis (ICA), regression and 
      high-order statistics has been proposed to identify and eliminate artifactual 
      activities from EEG data. We used simulated, experimental and standard EEG 
      signals to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results 
      demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove ocular artifacts as 
      well as it can preserve the neuronal signals present in EEG data. A comparison 
      with four methods from literature namely ICA, regression analysis, wavelet-ICA 
      (wICA), and regression-ICA (REGICA) confirms the significantly enhanced 
      performance and effectiveness of the proposed method for removal of ocular 
      activities from EEG, in terms of lower mean square error and mean absolute error 
      values and higher mutual information between reconstructed and original EEG.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel neurophysiology based performance analysis of 
      automated seizure detection algorithms for neonatal EEG to characterize features 
      of detected and non-detected seizures and causes of false detections to identify 
      areas for algorithmic improvement. METHODS: EEGs of 20 term neonates were 
      recorded (10 seizure, 10 non-seizure). Seizures were annotated by an expert and 
      characterized using a novel set of 10 criteria. ANSeR seizure detection algorithm 
      (SDA) seizure annotations were compared to the expert to derive detected and 
      non-detected seizures at three SDA sensitivity thresholds. Differences in seizure 
      characteristics between groups were compared using univariate and multivariate 
      analysis. False detections were characterized. RESULTS: The expert detected 421 
      seizures. The SDA at thresholds 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 detected 60%, 54% and 45% of 
      seizures. At all thresholds, multivariate analyses demonstrated that the odds of 
      detecting seizure increased with 4 criteria: seizure amplitude, duration, 
      rhythmicity and number of EEG channels involved at seizure peak. Major causes of 
      false detections included respiration and sweat artefacts or a highly rhythmic 
      background, often during intermediate sleep. CONCLUSION: This rigorous analysis 
      allows estimation of how key seizure features are exploited by SDAs. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study resulted in a beta version of ANSeR with significantly 
      improved performance.

LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.02.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Signal segmentation and spike detection are two 
      important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary 
      signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be 
      found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation 
      entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE 
      is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally 
      fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key 
      shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt-Pompe procedure, 
      only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding 
      the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude 
      values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we 
      propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation 
      entropy (AAPE). METHODS: AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in 
      addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than 
      the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how 
      the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike 
      detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, 
      electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance 
      of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the 
      significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. 
      RESULTS: In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than 
      conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the 
      presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes 
      well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample 
      spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE. CONCLUSION: We introduce a new 
      entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the 
      formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every 
      irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We 
      also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective connectivity can be explored using direct electrical 
      stimulations in patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsies and 
      investigated with intracranial electrodes. Responses to brief electrical pulses 
      mimic the physiological propagation of signals and manifest as cortico-cortical 
      evoked potentials (CCEP). The first CCEP component is believed to reflect direct 
      connectivity with the stimulated region but the stimulation artifact, a sharp 
      deflection occurring during a few milliseconds, frequently contaminates it. NEW 
      METHOD: In order to recover the characteristics of early CCEP responses, we 
      developed an artifact correction method based on electrical modeling of the 
      electrode-tissue interface. The biophysically motivated artifact templates are 
      then regressed out of the recorded data as in any classical template-matching 
      removal artifact methods. RESULTS: Our approach is able to make the distinction 
      between the physiological responses time-locked to the stimulation pulses and the 
      non-physiological component. We tested the correction on simulated CCEP data in 
      order to quantify its efficiency for different stimulation and recording 
      parameters. We demonstrated the efficiency of the new correction method on 
      simulations of single trial recordings for early responses contaminated with the 
      stimulation artifact. The results highlight the importance of sampling frequency 
      for an accurate analysis of CCEP. We then applied the approach to experimental 
      data. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The model-based template removal was 
      compared to a correction based on the subtraction of the averaged artifact. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This new correction method of stimulation artifact will enable 
      investigators to better analyze early CCEP components and infer direct effective 
      connectivity in future CCEP studies.

      application.
LID - 10.3390/s16040590 [doi]
LID - 590
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised method to automatically characterize 
      and detect events in multichannel signals. This method is used to identify 
      artifacts in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain activity. The 
      proposed algorithm has been evaluated and compared with a supervised method. To 
      this end an example of the performance of the algorithm to detect artifacts is 
      shown. The results show that although both methods obtain similar classification, 
      the proposed method allows detecting events without training data and can also be 
      applied in signals whose events are unknown a priori. Furthermore, the proposed 
      method provides an optimal window whereby an optimal detection and 
      characterization of events is found. The detection of events can be applied in 
      real-time.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a technique for recording the asynchronous 
      activation of neuronal firing inside the brain with non-invasive scalp 
      electrodes. Artifacts, such as eye blink activities, can corrupt these neuronal 
      signals. While ocular artifact (OA) removal is well investigated for multiple 
      channel EEG systems, in alignment with the recent momentum toward minimalistic 
      EEG systems for use in natural environments, we investigate unsupervised and 
      effective removal of OA from single-channel streaming raw EEG data. In this 
      paper, the unsupervised wavelet transform (WT) decomposition technique was 
      systematically evaluated for the effectiveness of OA removal for a single-channel 
      EEG system. A set of seven raw EEG data set was analyzed. Two commonly used WT 
      methods, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), 
      were applied. Four WT basis functions, namely, haar, coif3, sym3, and bior4.4, 
      were considered for OA removal with universal threshold and statistical threshold 
      (ST). To quantify OA removal efficacy from single-channel EEG, five performance 
      metrics were utilized: correlation coefficients, mutual information, 
      signal-to-artifact ratio, normalized mean square error, and time-frequency 
      analysis. The temporal and spectral analysis shows that the optimal combination 
      could be DWT with ST with coif3 or bior4.4 to remove OA among 16 combinations. 
      This paper demonstrates that the WT can be an effective tool for unsupervised OA 
      removal from single-channel EEG data for real-time applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a computational method to detect and quantify burst 
      suppression patterns (BSP) in the EEGs of critical care patients. A multi-center 
      validation study was performed to assess the detection performance of the method. 
      METHODS: The fully automatic method scans the EEG for discontinuous patterns and 
      shows detected BSP and quantitative information on a trending display in 
      real-time. The method is designed to work without setting any patient specific 
      parameters and to be insensitive to EEG artifacts and periodic patterns. For 
      validation a total of 3982 h of EEG from 88 patients were analyzed from three 
      centers. Each EEG was annotated by two reviewers to assess the detection 
      performance and the inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: Average inter-rater agreement 
      between pairs of reviewers was κ=0.69. On average 22% of the review segments 
      included BSP. An average sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 84% were 
      measured on the consensus annotations of two reviewers. More than 95% of the 
      periodic patterns in the EEGs were correctly suppressed. CONCLUSION: A fully 
      automatic method to detect burst suppression patterns was assessed in a 
      multi-center study. The method showed high sensitivity and specificity. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Clinically applicable burst suppression detection method validated 
      in a large multi-center study.

AB  - Head motions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) impair fMRI data 
      quality and introduce systematic artifacts that can affect interpretation of fMRI 
      results. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings performed simultaneously with 
      fMRI provide high-temporal-resolution information about ongoing brain activity as 
      well as head movements. Recently, an EEG-assisted retrospective motion correction 
      (E-REMCOR) method was introduced. E-REMCOR utilizes EEG motion artifacts to 
      correct the effects of head movements in simultaneously acquired fMRI data on a 
      slice-by-slice basis. While E-REMCOR is an efficient motion correction approach, 
      it involves an independent component analysis (ICA) of the EEG data and 
      identification of motion-related ICs. Here we report an automated implementation 
      of E-REMCOR, referred to as aE-REMCOR, which we developed to facilitate the 
      application of E-REMCOR in large-scale EEG-fMRI studies. The aE-REMCOR algorithm, 
      implemented in MATLAB, enables an automated preprocessing of the EEG data, an ICA 
      decomposition, and, importantly, an automatic identification of motion-related 
      ICs. aE-REMCOR has been used to perform retrospective motion correction for 305 
      fMRI datasets from 16 subjects, who participated in EEG-fMRI experiments 
      conducted on a 3T MRI scanner. Performance of aE-REMCOR has been evaluated based 
      on improvement in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of the fMRI data, as well 
      as correction efficiency defined in terms of spike reduction in fMRI motion 
      parameters. The results show that aE-REMCOR is capable of substantially reducing 
      head motion artifacts in fMRI data. In particular, when there are significant 
      rapid head movements during the scan, a large TSNR improvement and high 
      correction efficiency can be achieved. Depending on a subject's motion, an 
      average TSNR improvement over the brain upon the application of aE-REMCOR can be 
      as high as 27%, with top ten percent of the TSNR improvement values exceeding 
      55%. The average correction efficiency over the 305 fMRI scans is 18% and the 
      largest achieved efficiency is 71%. The utility of aE-REMCOR on the resting state 
      fMRI connectivity of the default mode network is also examined. The 
      motion-induced position-dependent error in the DMN connectivity analysis is shown 
      to be reduced when aE-REMCOR is utilized. These results demonstrate that 
      aE-REMCOR can be conveniently and efficiently used to improve fMRI motion 
      correction in large clinical EEG-fMRI studies.

      analysis and beamforming.

LID - 10.1111/psyp.12593 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal activity in the gamma-band range was long considered a marker of object 
      representation. However, scalp-recorded EEG activity in this range is 
      contaminated by a miniature saccade-related muscle artifact. Independent 
      component analysis (ICA) has been proposed as a method of removal of such 
      artifacts. Alternatively, beamforming, a source analysis method in which 
      potential sources of activity across the whole brain are scanned independently 
      through the use of adaptive spatial filters, offers a promising method of 
      accounting for the artifact without relying on its explicit removal. We present 
      here the application of ICA-based correction to a previously published dataset. 
      Then, using beamforming, we examine the effect of ICA correction on the 
      scalp-recorded EEG signal and the extent to which genuine activity is recoverable 
      before and after ICA correction. We find that beamforming attributes much of the 
      scalp-recorded gamma-band signal before correction to deep frontal sources, 
      likely the eye muscles, which generate the artifact related to each miniature 
      saccade. Beamforming confirms that what is removed by ICA is predominantly this 
      artifactual signal, and that what remains after correction plausibly originates 
      in the visual cortex. Thus, beamforming allows researchers to confirm whether 
      their removal procedures successfully removed the artifact. Our results 
      demonstrate that ICA-based correction brings about general improvements in 
      signal-to-noise ratio suggesting it should be used along with, rather than be 
      replaced by, beamforming.

TI  - Evaluation of Dry Sensors for Neonatal EEG Recordings.
PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0000000000000237 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Neonatal seizures are a common neurologic diagnosis in neonatal 
      intensive care units, occurring in approximately 14,000 newborns annually in the 
      United States. Although the only reliable means of detecting and treating 
      neonatal seizures is with an electroencephalography (EEG) recording, many 
      neonates do not receive an EEG or experience delays in getting them. Barriers to 
      obtaining neonatal EEGs include (1) lack of skilled EEG technologists to apply 
      conventional wet electrodes to delicate neonatal skin, (2) poor signal quality 
      because of improper skin preparation and artifact, and (3) extensive time needed 
      to apply electrodes. Dry sensors have the potential to overcome these obstacles 
      but have not previously been evaluated on neonates. METHODS: Sequential and 
      simultaneous recordings with wet and dry sensors were performed for 1 hour on 27 
      neonates from 35 to 42.5 weeks postmenstrual age. Recordings were analyzed for 
      correlation and amplitude and were reviewed by neurophysiologists. Performance of 
      dry sensors on simulated vernix was examined. RESULTS: Analysis of dry and wet 
      signals showed good time-domain correlation (reaching >0.8), given the 
      nonsuperimposed sensor positions and similar power spectral density curves. 
      Neurophysiologist reviews showed no statistically significant difference between 
      dry and wet data on most clinically relevant EEG background and seizure patterns. 
      There was no skin injury after 1 hour of dry sensor recordings. In contrast to 
      wet electrodes, impedance and electrical artifact of dry sensors were largely 
      unaffected by simulated vernix. CONCLUSIONS: Dry sensors evaluated in this study 
      have the potential to provide high-quality, timely EEG recordings on neonates 
      with less risk of skin injury.

AB  - Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has until now mostly been 
      administered as an alternating sinusoidal wave. Despite modern tACS stimulators 
      being able to deliver alternating current with any arbitrary shape there has been 
      no systematic exploration into the relative benefits of different waveforms. As 
      tACS is a relatively new technique there is a huge parameter space of unexplored 
      possibilities which may prove superior or complimentary to the traditional 
      sinusoidal waveform. Here, we begin to address this with an investigation into 
      the effects of sawtooth wave tACS on individual alpha power. Evidence from animal 
      models suggests that the gradient and direction of an electric current should be 
      important factors for the subsequent neural firing rate; we compared positive and 
      negative ramp sawtooth waves to test this. An additional advantage of sawtooth 
      waves is that the resulting artifact in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording 
      is significantly simpler to remove than a sine wave; accordingly we were able to 
      observe alpha oscillations both during and after stimulation. We found that 
      positive ramp sawtooth, but not negative ramp sawtooth, significantly enhanced 
      alpha power during stimulation relative to sham (p < 0.01). In addition we tested 
      for an after-effect of both sawtooth and sinusoidal stimulation on alpha power 
      but in this case did not find any significant effect. This preliminary study 
      paves the way for further investigations into the effect of the gradient and 
      direction of the current in tACS which could significantly improve the usefulness 
      of this technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle artifacts and electrode noise are an obstacle to 
      interpretation of EEG and other electrophysiological signals. They are often 
      channel-specific and do not fully benefit from component analysis techniques such 
      as ICA, and their presence reduces the dimensionality needed by those techniques. 
      Their high-frequency content may mask or masquerade as gamma band cortical 
      activity. NEW METHOD: The sparse time artifact removal (STAR) algorithm removes 
      artifacts that are sparse in space and time. The time axis is partitioned into an 
      artifact-free and an artifact-contaminated part, and the correlation structure of 
      the data is estimated from the covariance matrix of the artifact-free part. 
      Artifacts are then corrected by projection of each channel onto the subspace 
      spanned by the other channels. RESULTS: The method is evaluated with both 
      simulated and real data, and found to be highly effective in removing or 
      attenuating typical channel-specific artifacts. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: 
      In contrast to the widespread practice of trial removal or channel removal or 
      interpolation, very few data are lost. In contrast to ICA or other linear 
      techniques, processing is local in time and affects only the artifact part, so 
      most of the data are identical to the unprocessed data and the full 
      dimensionality of the data is preserved. CONCLUSIONS: STAR complements other 
      linear component analysis techniques, and can enhance their ability to discover 
      weak sources of interest by increasing the number of effective noise-free 
      channels.

      Component Analysis.
PG  - 309-19

AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely applied to 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) biosignal processing and brain-computer interfaces. 
      The practical use of ICA, however, is limited by its computational complexity, 
      data requirements for convergence, and assumption of data stationarity, 
      especially for high-density data. Here we study and validate an optimized online 
      recursive ICA algorithm (ORICA) with online recursive least squares (RLS) 
      whitening for blind source separation of high-density EEG data, which offers 
      instantaneous incremental convergence upon presentation of new data. Empirical 
      results of this study demonstrate the algorithm's: 1) suitability for accurate 
      and efficient source identification in high-density (64-channel) 
      realistically-simulated EEG data; 2) capability to detect and adapt to 
      nonstationarity in 64-ch simulated EEG data; and 3) utility for rapidly 
      extracting principal brain and artifact sources in real 61-channel EEG data 
      recorded by a dry and wearable EEG system in a cognitive experiment. ORICA was 
      implemented as functions in BCILAB and EEGLAB and was integrated in an 
      open-source Real-time EEG Source-mapping Toolbox (REST), supporting applications 
      in ICA-based online artifact rejection, feature extraction for real-time 
      biosignal monitoring in clinical environments, and adaptable classifications in 
      brain-computer interfaces.

AB  - Combining electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) offers the potential for imaging brain activity with high spatial 
      and temporal resolution. This potential remains limited by the significant 
      ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts induced in the EEG by cardiac 
      pulsation-related head movement within the magnetic field. We model the BCG 
      artifact using a harmonic basis, pose the artifact removal problem as a local 
      harmonic regression analysis, and develop an efficient maximum likelihood 
      algorithm to estimate and remove BCG artifacts. Our analysis paradigm accounts 
      for time-frequency overlap between the BCG artifacts and neurophysiologic EEG 
      signals, and tracks the spatiotemporal variations in both the artifact and the 
      signal. We evaluate performance on: simulated oscillatory and evoked responses 
      constructed with realistic artifacts; actual anesthesia-induced oscillatory 
      recordings; and actual visual evoked potential recordings. In each case, the 
      local harmonic regression analysis effectively removes the BCG artifacts, and 
      recovers the neurophysiologic EEG signals. We further show that our algorithm 
      outperforms commonly used reference-based and component analysis techniques, 
      particularly in low SNR conditions, the presence of significant time-frequency 
      overlap between the artifact and the signal, and/or large spatiotemporal 
      variations in the BCG. Because our algorithm does not require reference signals 
      and has low computational complexity, it offers a practical tool for removing BCG 
      artifacts from EEG data recorded in combination with fMRI.

AB  - So far, Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have been mainly used to study brain 
      potentials during movement-free conditions. Recently, due to the emerging concern 
      of improving rehabilitation therapies, these systems are also being used during 
      gait experiments. Under this new condition, the evaluation of motion artifacts 
      has become a critical point to assure the validity of the results obtained. Due 
      to the high signal to noise ratio provided, the use of wet electrodes is a widely 
      accepted technic to acquire electroencephalographic (EEG signals). To perform 
      these recordings it is necessary to apply a conductive gel between the scalp and 
      the electrodes. This work is focused on the study of gel displacements produced 
      during ambulation and how they affect the amplitude of EEG signals. Data recorded 
      during three ambulation conditions (gait training) and one movement-free 
      condition (BMI motor imagery task) are compared to perform this study. Two 
      phenomenons, manifested as unusual increases of the signals' amplitude, have been 
      identified and characterized during this work. Results suggest that they are 
      caused by abrupt changes on the conductivity between the electrode and the scalp 
      due to gel displacement produced during ambulation and head movements. These 
      artifacts significantly increase the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of EEG 
      recordings at all frequencies from 5 to 90 Hz, corresponding to the main 
      bandwidth of electrocortical potentials. They should be taken into consideration 
      before performing EEG recordings in order to asses the correct gel allocation and 
      to avoid the use of electrodes on certain scalp areas depending on the 
      experimental conditions.

AB  - Sleeping brain activity reflects brain anatomy and physiology. The aim of this 
      study was to use high density (256 channel) electroencephalography (EEG) during 
      sleep to characterize topographic changes in sleep EEG power across normal aging, 
      with high spatial resolution. Sleep was evaluated in 92 healthy adults aged 18-65 
      years old using full polysomnography and high density EEG. After artifact 
      removal, spectral power density was calculated for standard frequency bands for 
      all channels, averaged across the NREM periods of the first 3 sleep cycles. To 
      quantify topographic changes with age, maps were generated of the Pearson's 
      coefficient of the correlation between power and age at each electrode. 
      Significant correlations were determined by statistical non-parametric mapping. 
      Absolute slow wave power declined significantly with increasing age across the 
      entire scalp, whereas declines in theta and sigma power were significant only in 
      frontal regions. Power in fast spindle frequencies declined significantly with 
      increasing age frontally, whereas absolute power of slow spindle frequencies 
      showed no significant change with age. When EEG power was normalized across the 
      scalp, a left centro-parietal region showed significantly less age-related 
      decline in power than the rest of the scalp. This partial preservation was 
      particularly significant in the slow wave and sigma bands. The effect of age on 
      sleep EEG varies substantially by region and frequency band. This non-uniformity 
      should inform the design of future investigations of aging and sleep. This study 
      provides normative data on the effect of age on sleep EEG topography, and 
      provides a basis from which to explore the mechanisms of normal aging as well as 
      neurodegenerative disorders for which age is a risk factor.

AB  - Contamination of eye movement and blink artifacts in Electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      recording makes the analysis of EEG data more difficult and could result in 
      mislead findings. Efficient removal of these artifacts from EEG data is an 
      essential step in improving classification accuracy to develop the brain-computer 
      interface (BCI). In this paper, we proposed an automatic framework based on 
      independent component analysis (ICA) and system identification to identify and 
      remove ocular artifacts from EEG data by using hybrid EEG and eye tracker system. 
      The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using experimental and 
      standard EEG datasets. The proposed algorithm not only removes the ocular 
      artifacts from artifactual zone but also preserves the neuronal activity related 
      EEG signals in non-artifactual zone. The comparison with the two state-of-the-art 
      techniques namely ADJUST based ICA and REGICA reveals the significant improved 
      performance of the proposed algorithm for removing eye movement and blink 
      artifacts from EEG data. Additionally, results demonstrate that the proposed 
      algorithm can achieve lower relative error and higher mutual information values 
      between corrected EEG and artifact-free EEG data.

      Implant Users Measured with Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.
PG  - 48

AB  - BACKGROUND: Speech understanding may rely not only on auditory, but also on 
      visual information. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques can expose 
      the neural processes underlying the integration of multisensory processes 
      required for speech understanding in humans. Nevertheless, noise (from functional 
      MRI, fMRI) limits the usefulness in auditory experiments, and electromagnetic 
      artifacts caused by electronic implants worn by subjects can severely distort the 
      scans (EEG, fMRI). Therefore, we assessed audio-visual activation of temporal 
      cortex with a silent, optical neuroimaging technique: functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: We studied temporal cortical activation as 
      represented by concentration changes of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin in four, 
      easy-to-apply fNIRS optical channels of 33 normal-hearing adult subjects and five 
      post-lingually deaf cochlear implant (CI) users in response to supra-threshold 
      unisensory auditory and visual, as well as to congruent auditory-visual speech 
      stimuli. RESULTS: Activation effects were not visible from single fNIRS channels. 
      However, by discounting physiological noise through reference channel subtraction 
      (RCS), auditory, visual and audiovisual (AV) speech stimuli evoked concentration 
      changes for all sensory modalities in both cohorts (p < 0.001). Auditory 
      stimulation evoked larger concentration changes than visual stimuli (p < 0.001). 
      A saturation effect was observed for the AV condition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Physiological, systemic noise can be removed from fNIRS signals by RCS. The 
      observed multisensory enhancement of an auditory cortical channel can be 
      plausibly described by a simple addition of the auditory and visual signals with 
      saturation.

TI  - Alpha desynchronization and fronto-parietal connectivity during spatial working 
      memory encoding deficits in ADHD: A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms of alpha band (8-12 Hz) neural oscillations are of 
      importance to the functioning of attention control systems as well as to 
      neuropsychiatric conditions that are characterized by deficits of that system, 
      such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objectives of the 
      present study were to test if visual encoding-related alpha event-related 
      desynchronization (ERD) correlates with fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity, 
      and whether this is disrupted in ADHD during spatial working memory (SWM) 
      performance. We acquired EEG concurrently with fMRI in thirty boys (12-16 yrs. 
      old, 15 with ADHD), during SWM encoding. Psychophysiological connectivity 
      analyses indicated that alpha ERD during SWM encoding was associated with both 
      occipital activation and fronto-parieto-occipital functional connectivity, a 
      finding that expands on prior associations between alpha ERD and occipital 
      activation. This finding provides novel support for the interpretation of alpha 
      ERD (and the associated changes in occipital activation) as a phenomenon that 
      involves, and perhaps arises as a result of, top-down network interactions. Alpha 
      ERD was associated less strongly with occipital activity, but associated more 
      strongly with fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity in ADHD, consistent with a 
      compensatory attentional response. Additionally, we illustrate that degradation 
      of EEG data quality by MRI-amplified motion artifacts is robust to existing 
      cleaning algorithms and is significantly correlated with hyperactivity symptoms 
      and the ADHD Combined Type diagnosis. We conclude that persistent motion-related 
      MR artifacts in EEG data can increase variance and introduce bias in 
      interpretation of group differences in populations characterized by 
      hypermobility--a clear limitation of current-state EEG-fMRI methodology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG are 
      a potential biomarker of epilepsy, but current automated HFO detectors require 
      human review to remove artifacts. Our objective is to automatically redact false 
      HFO detections, facilitating clinical use of interictal HFOs. METHODS: 
      Intracranial EEG data from 23 patients were processed with automated detectors of 
      HFOs and artifacts. HFOs not concurrent with artifacts were labeled quality HFOs 
      (qHFOs). Methods were validated by human review on a subset of 2000 events. The 
      correlation of qHFO rates with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) was assessed via (1) 
      a retrospective asymmetry measure and (2) a novel quasi-prospective algorithm to 
      identify SOZ. RESULTS: Human review estimated that less than 12% of qHFOs are 
      artifacts, whereas 78.5% of redacted HFOs are artifacts. The qHFO rate was more 
      correlated with SOZ (p=0.020, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and resected volume 
      (p=0.0037) than baseline detections. Using qHFOs, our algorithm was able to 
      determine SOZ in 60% of the ILAE Class I patients, with all 
      algorithmically-determined SOZs fully within the resected volumes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The algorithm reduced false-positive HFO detections, improving the precision of 
      the HFO-biomarker. SIGNIFICANCE: These methods provide a feasible strategy for 
      HFO detection in real-time, continuous EEG with minimal human monitoring of data 
      quality.

TI  - Large-Scale Functional Networks Identified from Resting-State EEG Using Spatial 
      ICA.
PG  - e0146845

AB  - Several methods have been applied to EEG or MEG signals to detect functional 
      networks. In recent works using MEG/EEG and fMRI data, temporal ICA analysis has 
      been used to extract spatial maps of resting-state networks with or without an 
      atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. Since the links between the fMRI signal 
      and the electromagnetic signals are not fully established, and to avoid any bias, 
      we examined whether EEG alone was able to derive the spatial distribution and 
      temporal characteristics of functional networks. To do so, we propose a two-step 
      original method: 1) An individual multi-frequency data analysis including 
      EEG-based source localisation and spatial independent component analysis, which 
      allowed us to characterize the resting-state networks. 2) A group-level analysis 
      involving a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify reproducible 
      large-scale networks across the population. Compared with large-scale 
      resting-state networks obtained with fMRI, the proposed EEG-based analysis 
      revealed smaller independent networks thanks to the high temporal resolution of 
      EEG, hence hierarchical organization of networks. The comparison showed a 
      substantial overlap between EEG and fMRI networks in motor, premotor, sensory, 
      frontal, and parietal areas. However, there were mismatches between EEG-based and 
      fMRI-based networks in temporal areas, presumably resulting from a poor 
      sensitivity of fMRI in these regions or artefacts in the EEG signals. The 
      proposed method opens the way for studying the high temporal dynamics of networks 
      at the source level thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG. It would then 
      become possible to study detailed measures of the dynamics of connectivity.

      corrections--A validation of a real-time simultaneous EEG/fMRI correction method.

AB  - Simultaneous EEG-fMRI combines two powerful neuroimaging techniques, but the EEG 
      signal suffers from severe artifacts in the MRI environment that are difficult to 
      remove. These are the MR scanning artifact and the blood-pulsation 
      artifact--strategies to remove them are a topic of ongoing research. Additionally 
      large, unsystematic artifacts are produced across the full frequency spectrum by 
      the magnet's helium pump (and ventilator) systems which are notoriously hard to 
      remove. As a consequence, experimenters routinely deactivate the helium pump 
      during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions which potentially risks damaging the 
      MRI system and necessitates more frequent and expensive helium refills. We 
      present a novel correction method addressing both helium pump and 
      ballisto-cardiac (BCG) artifacts, consisting of carbon-wire loops (CWL) as 
      additional sensors to accurately track unpredictable artifacts related to subtle 
      movements in the scanner, and an EEGLAB plugin to perform artifact correction. We 
      compare signal-to-noise metrics of EEG data, corrected with CWL and three 
      conventional correction methods, for helium pump off and on measurements. Because 
      the CWL setup records signals in real-time, it fits requirements of applications 
      where immediate correction is necessary, such as neuro-feedback applications or 
      stimulation time-locked to specific sleep oscillations. The comparison metrics in 
      this paper relate to: (1) the EEG signal itself, (2) the "eyes open vs. eyes 
      closed" effect, and (3) an assessment of how the artifact corrections impacts the 
      ability to perform meaningful correlations between EEG alpha power and the BOLD 
      signal. Results show that the CWL correction corrects for He pump artifact and 
      also produces EEG data more comparable to EEG obtained outside the magnet than 
      conventional post-processing methods.

AB  - Recent mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) techniques based on active electrode 
      scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) allow the acquisition and real-time analysis of 
      brain dynamics during active unrestrained motor behavior involving whole body 
      movements such as treadmill walking, over-ground walking and other locomotive and 
      non-locomotive tasks. Unfortunately, MoBI protocols are prone to physiological 
      and non-physiological artifacts, including motion artifacts that may contaminate 
      the EEG recordings. A few attempts have been made to quantify these artifacts 
      during locomotion tasks but with inconclusive results due in part to 
      methodological pitfalls. In this paper, we investigate the potential 
      contributions of motion artifacts in scalp EEG during treadmill walking at three 
      different speeds (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 km/h) using a wireless 64 channel active EEG 
      system and a wireless inertial sensor attached to the subject's head. The 
      experimental setup was designed according to good measurement practices using 
      state-of-the-art commercially available instruments, and the measurements were 
      analyzed using Fourier analysis and wavelet coherence approaches. Contrary to 
      prior claims, the subjects' motion did not significantly affect their EEG during 
      treadmill walking although precaution should be taken when gait speeds approach 
      4.5 km/h. Overall, these findings suggest how MoBI methods may be safely deployed 
      in neural, cognitive, and rehabilitation engineering applications.

TI  - Higher Balance Task Demands are Associated with an Increase in Individual Alpha 
      Peak Frequency.
PG  - 695
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00695 [doi]
LID - 695
AB  - Balance control is fundamental for most daily motor activities, and its 
      impairment is associated with an increased risk of falling. Growing evidence 
      suggests the human cortex is essentially contributing to the control of standing 
      balance. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and need further 
      investigation. In a previous study, we introduced a new protocol to identify 
      electrocortical activity associated with performance of different continuous 
      balance tasks with the eyes opened. The aim of this study was to extend our 
      previous results by investigating the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), a 
      neurophysiological marker of thalamo-cortical information transmission, which 
      remained unconsidered so far in balance research. Thirty-seven subjects completed 
      nine balance tasks varying in surface stability and base of support. 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 32 scalp locations throughout 
      balancing with the eyes closed to ensure reliable identification of the iAPF. 
      Balance performance was quantified as the sum of anterior-posterior and 
      medio-lateral movements of the supporting platform. The iAPF, as well as power in 
      the theta, lower alpha and upper alpha frequency bands were determined for each 
      balance task after applying an ICA-based artifact rejection procedure. Higher 
      demands on balance control were associated with a global increase in iAPF and a 
      decrease in lower alpha power. These results may indicate increased 
      thalamo-cortical information transfer and general cortical activation, 
      respectively. In addition, a significant increase in upper alpha activity was 
      observed in the fronto-central region whereas it decreased in the centro-parietal 
      region. Furthermore, midline theta increased with higher task demands probably 
      indicating activation of error detection/processing mechanisms. IAPF as well as 
      theta and alpha power were correlated with platform movements. The results 
      provide new insights into spectral and spatial characteristics of cortical 
      oscillations subserving balance control. This information may be particularly 
      useful in a clinical context as it could be used to reveal cortical contributions 
      to balance dysfunction in specific populations such as Parkinson's or vestibular 
      loss. However, this should be addressed in future studies.

TI  - Postinsertional Cable Movements of Cochlear Implant Electrodes and Their Effects 
      on Intracochlear Pressure.
PG  - 3937196
LID - 3937196
AB  - Introduction. To achieve a functional atraumatic cochlear implantation, 
      intracochlear pressure changes during the procedure should be minimized. 
      Postinsertional cable movements are assumed to induce intracochlear pressure 
      changes. The aim of this study was to observe intracochlear pressure changes due 
      to postinsertional cable movements. Materials and Methods. Intracochlear pressure 
      changes were recorded in a cochlear model with a micro-pressure sensor positioned 
      in the apical region of the cochlea model to follow the maximum amplitude and 
      pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure. A temporal bone mastoid cavity 
      was attached to the model to simulate cable positioning. The compared conditions 
      were (1) touching the unsealed electrode, (2) touching the sealed electrode, (3) 
      cable storage with an unfixed cable, and (4) cable storage with a fixed cable. 
      Results. We found statistically significant differences in the occurrence of 
      maximum amplitude and pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure changes 
      under the compared conditions. Comparing the cable storage conditions, a cable 
      fixed mode offers significantly lower maximum pressure amplitude and pressure 
      gain velocity than the nonfixed mode. Conclusion. Postinsertional cable movement 
      led to a significant pressure transfer into the cochlea. Before positioning the 
      electrode cable in the mastoid cavity, fixation of the cable is recommended.

TI  - Driving Drowsiness Detection Using Fusion of Electroencephalography, 
      Electrooculography, and Driving Quality Signals.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - This study investigates the detection of the drowsiness state (DS) for future 
      application such as in the reduction of the road traffic accidents. The 
      electroencephalography, electrooculography, driving quality, and Karolinska 
      sleepiness scale data of 7 males during approximately 20 h of sleep deprivation 
      were recorded. To reduce the eye blink artifact, an automatic mechanism based on 
      the independent component analysis method and Higuchi's fractal dimension has 
      been applied. After recordings, for selecting the best subset of features, a new 
      combined method, called class separability feature selection-sequential feature 
      selection, has been developed. This method reduces the time of calculations from 
      6807 to 2096 s (by 69.21%) while the classification accuracy remains relatively 
      unchanged. For diagnosis of the DS and classification of the state, a new 
      approach based on a self-organized map network is used. First, using the data 
      obtained from two classes of awareness state (AS) and DS, the network achieved an 
      accuracy of 76.51 ± 3.43%. Using data from three classes of AS, AS/DS (passing 
      from awareness to drowsiness), and DS to the network, an accuracy of 62.70 ± 
      3.65% was achieved. It is suggested that the DS during driving is detectable with 
      an unsupervised network.

AB  - In resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) 
      studies, measures of functional connectivity are often calculated after the 
      removal of a global mean signal component. While the application of the global 
      signal regression approach has been shown to reduce the influence of 
      physiological artifacts and enhance the detection of functional networks, there 
      is considerable controversy regarding its use as the method can lead to 
      significant bias in the resultant connectivity measures. In addition, evidence 
      from recent studies suggests that the global signal is linked to neural activity 
      and may carry clinically relevant information. For instance, in a prior study we 
      found that the amplitude of the global signal was negatively correlated with EEG 
      measures of vigilance across subjects and experimental runs. Furthermore, 
      caffeine-related decreases in global signal amplitude were associated with 
      increases in EEG vigilance. In this study, we extend the prior work by examining 
      measures of global signal amplitude and EEG vigilance under eyes-closed (EC) and 
      eyes-open (EO) resting-state conditions. We show that changes (EO minus EC) in 
      the global signal amplitude are negatively correlated with the associated changes 
      in EEG vigilance. The slope of this EO-EC relation is comparable with the slope 
      of the previously reported relation between caffeine-related changes in the 
      global signal amplitude and EEG vigilance. Our findings provide further support 
      for a basic relationship between global signal amplitude and EEG vigilance.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Artifact-Related Independent Components for Artifact 
      Removal in EEG Recordings.
PG  - 73-81
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2014.2370646 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity produced by 
      the firing of neurons within the brain. These activities can be decoded by signal 
      processing techniques. However, EEG recordings are always contaminated with 
      artifacts which hinder the decoding process. Therefore, identifying and removing 
      artifacts is an important step. Researchers often clean EEG recordings with 
      assistance from independent component analysis (ICA), since it can decompose EEG 
      recordings into a number of artifact-related and event-related potential 
      (ERP)-related independent components. However, existing ICA-based artifact 
      identification strategies mostly restrict themselves to a subset of artifacts, 
      e.g., identifying eye movement artifacts only, and have not been shown to 
      reliably identify artifacts caused by nonbiological origins like high-impedance 
      electrodes. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm for the 
      identification of general artifacts. The proposed algorithm consists of two 
      parts: 1) an event-related feature-based clustering algorithm used to identify 
      artifacts which have physiological origins; and 2) the electrode-scalp impedance 
      information employed for identifying nonbiological artifacts. The results on EEG 
      data collected from ten subjects show that our algorithm can effectively detect, 
      separate, and remove both physiological and nonbiological artifacts. Qualitative 
      evaluation of the reconstructed EEG signals demonstrates that our proposed method 
      can effectively enhance the signal quality, especially the quality of ERPs, even 
      for those that barely display ERPs in the raw EEG. The performance results also 
      show that our proposed method can effectively identify artifacts and subsequently 
      enhance the classification accuracies compared to four commonly used automatic 
      artifact removal methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blind source separation techniques have become the de facto standard 
      for decomposing electroencephalographic (EEG) data. These methods are poorly 
      suited for incorporating prior information into the decomposition process. While 
      alternative techniques to this problem, such as the use of constrained 
      optimization techniques, have been proposed, these alternative techniques tend to 
      only minimally satisfy the prior constraints. In addition, the experimenter must 
      preset a number of parameters describing both this minimal limit as well as the 
      size of the target subspaces. NEW METHOD: We propose an informed decomposition 
      approach that builds upon the constrained optimization approaches for independent 
      components analysis to better model and separate distinct subspaces within EEG 
      data. We use a likelihood function to adaptively determine the optimal model size 
      for each target subspace. RESULTS: Using our method we are able to produce 
      ordered independent subspaces that exhibit less residual mixing than those 
      obtained with other methods. The results show an improvement in modeling specific 
      features of the EEG space, while also showing a simultaneous reduction in the 
      number of components needed for each model. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): 
      We first compare our approach to common methods in the field of EEG 
      decomposition, such as Infomax, FastICA, PCA, JADE, and SOBI for the task of 
      modeling and removing both EOG and EMG artifacts. We then demonstrate the utility 
      of our approach for the more complex problem of modeling neural activity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: By working in a one-size-fits-all fashion current EEG decomposition 
      methods do not adapt to the specifics of each data set and are not well designed 
      to incorporate additional information about the decomposition problem. However, 
      by adding specific information about the problem to the decomposition task, we 
      improve the identification and separation of distinct subspaces within the 
      original data and show better preservation of the remaining data.

TI  - Implementing a Smart Method to Eliminate Artifacts of Vital Signals.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) has vital and significant applications 
      in different medical fields and is used for the primary evaluation of 
      neurological disorders. Hence, having easy access to suitable and useful signal 
      is very important. Artifacts are undesirable confusions which are generally 
      originated from inevitable human activities such as heartbeat, blinking of eyes 
      and facial muscle activities while receiving EEG signal. It can bring about 
      deformation in these waves though. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to 
      find a suitable solution to eliminate the artifacts of Vital Signals. METHODS: In 
      this study, wavelet transform technique was used. This method is compared with 
      threshold level. The threshold intensity is efficiently crucial because it should 
      not remove the original signal instead of artifacts, and does not hold artifact 
      signal instead of original ones. In this project, we seek to find and implement 
      the algorithm with the ability to automatically remove the artifacts in EEG 
      signals. For this purpose, the use of adaptive filtering methods such as wavelet 
      analysis is appropriate. Finally, we observed that Functional Link Neural Network 
      (FLN) performance is better than ANFIS and RBFN to remove such artifacts. 
      RESULTS: We offer an intelligent method for removing artifacts from vital signals 
      in neurological disorders. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can obtain more 
      accurate results by removing artifacts of vital signals and can be useful in the 
      early diagnosis of neurological and cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - Independent Component Analysis of Gait-Related Movement Artifact Recorded using 
      EEG Electrodes during Treadmill Walking.

AB  - There has been a recent surge in the use of electroencephalography (EEG) as a 
      tool for mobile brain imaging due to its portability and fine time resolution. 
      When EEG is combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source 
      localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as arising from 
      temporally independent signals located in spatially distinct cortical areas. 
      However, for mobile tasks, it is not clear how movement artifacts influence ICA 
      and source localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement 
      artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a 256-channel EEG 
      system. We first blocked true electrocortical activity using a silicone swim cap. 
      Over the silicone layer, we placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties 
      similar to real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from ten 
      healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on a treadmill at 
      speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and dipole fitting on the EEG movement 
      artifact data to quantify how accurately these methods would identify the 
      artifact signals as non-neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99% 
      of the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked dipolar 
      characteristics. The remaining 1% of sources had locations within the brain 
      volume and low residual variances, but had topographical maps, power spectra, 
      time courses, and event related spectral perturbations typical of non-neural 
      sources. Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that includes 
      semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from human walking. 
      Alternative methods are needed for the identification and separation of movement 
      artifact in mobile EEG signals, especially methods that can be performed in real 
      time. Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear the way for 
      EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during mobile activities, such as 
      walking.

LID - 10.1097/WNP.0000000000000194 [doi]
AB  - Neurophysiology is an essential tool for clinicians dealing with patients in the 
      intensive care unit. Because of consciousness disorders, clinical examination is 
      frequently limited. In this setting, neurophysiological examination provides 
      valuable information about seizure detection, treatment guidance, and 
      neurological outcome. However, to acquire reliable signals, some technical 
      precautions need to be known. EEG is prone to artifacts, and the intensive care 
      unit environment is rich in artifact sources (electrical devices including 
      mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and sedative medications, and frequent noise, 
      etc.). This review will discuss and summarize the current technical guidelines 
      for EEG acquisition and also some practical pitfalls specific for the intensive 
      care unit.

TI  - On-Going Frontal Alpha Rhythms Are Dominant in Passive State and Desynchronize in 
      Active State in Adult Gray Mouse Lemurs.

AB  - The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is considered a useful primate model 
      for translational research. In the framework of IMI PharmaCog project (Grant 
      Agreement n°115009, www.pharmacog.org), we tested the hypothesis that spectral 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of motor and locomotor activity in gray 
      mouse lemurs reflect typical movement-related desynchronization of alpha rhythms 
      (about 8-12 Hz) in humans. To this aim, EEG (bipolar electrodes in frontal 
      cortex) and electromyographic (EMG; bipolar electrodes sutured in neck muscles) 
      data were recorded in 13 male adult (about 3 years) lemurs. Artifact-free EEG 
      segments during active state (gross movements, exploratory movements or locomotor 
      activity) and awake passive state (no sleep) were selected on the basis of 
      instrumental measures of animal behavior, and were used as an input for EEG power 
      density analysis. Results showed a clear peak of EEG power density at alpha range 
      (7-9 Hz) during passive state. During active state, there was a reduction in 
      alpha power density (8-12 Hz) and an increase of power density at slow 
      frequencies (1-4 Hz). Relative EMG activity was related to EEG power density at 
      2-4 Hz (positive correlation) and at 8-12 Hz (negative correlation). These 
      results suggest for the first time that the primate gray mouse lemurs and humans 
      may share basic neurophysiologic mechanisms of synchronization of frontal alpha 
      rhythms in awake passive state and their desynchronization during motor and 
      locomotor activity. These EEG markers may be an ideal experimental model for 
      translational basic (motor science) and applied (pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological interventions) research in Neurophysiology.

TI  - Neurophysiological differences between patients clinically at high risk for 
      schizophrenia and neurotypical controls--first steps in development of a 
      biomarker.
PG  - 276

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe, disabling and prevalent mental disorder 
      without cure and with a variable, incomplete pharmacotherapeutic response. Prior 
      to onset in adolescence or young adulthood a prodromal period of abnormal 
      symptoms lasting weeks to years has been identified and operationalized as 
      clinically high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia. However, only a minority of 
      subjects prospectively identified with CHR convert to schizophrenia, thereby 
      limiting enthusiasm for early intervention(s). This study utilized objective 
      resting electroencephalogram (EEG) quantification to determine whether CHR 
      constitutes a cohesive entity and an evoked potential to assess CHR cortical 
      auditory processing. METHODS: This study constitutes an EEG-based quantitative 
      neurophysiological comparison between two unmedicated subject groups: 35 
      neurotypical controls (CON) and 22 CHR patients. After artifact management, 
      principal component analysis (PCA) identified EEG spectral and spectral coherence 
      factors described by associated loading patterns. Discriminant function analysis 
      (DFA) determined factors' discrimination success between subjects in the CON and 
      CHR groups. Loading patterns on DFA-selected factors described CHR-specific 
      spectral and coherence differences when compared to controls. The frequency 
      modulated auditory evoked response (FMAER) explored functional CON-CHR 
      differences within the superior temporal gyri. RESULTS: Variable reduction by PCA 
      identified 40 coherence-based factors explaining 77.8% of the total variance and 
      40 spectral factors explaining 95.9% of the variance. DFA demonstrated 
      significant CON-CHR group difference (P <0.00001) and successful jackknifed 
      subject classification (CON, 85.7%; CHR, 86.4% correct). The population 
      distribution plotted along the canonical discriminant variable was clearly 
      bimodal. Coherence factors delineated loading patterns of altered connectivity 
      primarily involving the bilateral posterior temporal electrodes. However, FMAER 
      analysis showed no CON-CHR group differences. CONCLUSIONS: CHR subjects form a 
      cohesive group, significantly separable from CON subjects by EEG-derived indices. 
      Symptoms of CHR may relate to altered connectivity with the posterior temporal 
      regions but not to primary auditory processing abnormalities within these 
      regions.

AB  - GOAL: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system 
      and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state 
      classification. METHODS: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor 
      with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework 
      is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, 
      multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive 
      state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic 
      regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on 
      simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using 
      ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine 
      subjects using the dry EEG system. RESULTS: Simulations yielded high accuracy 
      (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response 
      error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time 
      direct-directed transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with 
      similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ±0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ±0.08) source 
      localization. Cortical ERP-based classification was equivalent to ProxConn for 
      cLORETA (0.74 ±0.16) but significantly better for LCMV (0.82 ±0.12) . CONCLUSION: 
      We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and 
      cognitive state classification from high-density wearable dry EEG. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry 
      EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and 
      interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the 
      wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and 
      brain-computer interfaces. The pipelines are made freely available in the 
      open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes.

TI  - Elevated synchrony in Parkinson disease detected with electroencephalography.
PG  - 742-50
LID - 10.1002/ana.24507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parkinson disease (PD) can be difficult to diagnose and treat. 
      Development of a biomarker for PD would reduce these challenges by providing an 
      objective measure of disease. Emerging theories suggest PD is characterized by 
      excessive synchronization in the beta frequency band (∼20Hz) throughout basal 
      ganglia-thalamocortical loops. Recently we showed with invasive 
      electrocorticography that one robust measure of this synchronization is the 
      coupling of beta phase to broadband gamma amplitude (ie, phase-amplitude coupling 
      [PAC]). Other recent work suggests that high-frequency activity is detectable at 
      the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). Motivated by these findings, we 
      tested whether beta-gamma PAC over sensorimotor cortex, recorded noninvasively 
      with EEG, differs between PD patients off and on medications, and healthy control 
      subjects. METHODS: Resting EEG was compared from 15 PD patients and 16 healthy 
      control subjects. PD patients were tested on and off medications on different 
      days, in a counterbalanced order. For each data set we calculated PAC and 
      compared results across groups. RESULTS: PAC was elevated in the patients off 
      medications compared to on medications (p = 0.008) and for patients off 
      medications compared to controls (p = 0.009). INTERPRETATION: Elevated PAC is 
      detectable using scalp EEG in PD patients off medications compared to on 
      medications, and compared to healthy controls. This suggests that EEG PAC may 
      provide a noninvasive biomarker of the parkinsonian state. This biomarker could 
      be used as a control signal for closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation 
      devices, for adjustment of dopaminergic treatment, and also has the potential to 
      aid in diagnosis.

AB  - Walking on two legs is inherently unstable. Still, we humans perform remarkable 
      well at it, mostly without falling. To gain more understanding of the role of the 
      brain in controlling gait stability we measured brain activity using 
      electro-encephalography (EEG) during stabilized and normal walking. Subjects 
      walked on a treadmill in two conditions, each lasting 10 min; normal, and while 
      being laterally stabilized by elastic cords. Kinematics of trunk and feet, 
      electro-myography (EMG) of neck muscles, as well as 64-channel EEG were recorded. 
      To assess gait stability the local divergence exponent, step width, and trunk 
      range of motion were calculated from the kinematic data. We used independent 
      component (IC) analysis to remove movement, EMG, and eyeblink artifacts from the 
      EEG, after which dynamic imaging of coherent sources beamformers were determined 
      to identify cortical sources that showed a significant difference between 
      conditions. Stabilized walking led to a significant increase in gait stability, 
      i.e., lower local divergence exponents. Beamforming analysis of the beta band 
      activity revealed significant sources in bilateral pre-motor cortices. Projection 
      of sensor data on these sources showed a significant difference only in the left 
      premotor area, with higher beta power during stabilized walking, specifically 
      around push-off, although only significant around contralateral push-off. It 
      appears that even during steady gait the cortex is involved in the control of 
      stability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, the signal of each 
      recording electrode is contrasted with a reference electrode or a combination of 
      electrodes. The estimation of a neutral reference is a long-standing issue in EEG 
      data analysis, which has motivated the proposal of different re-referencing 
      methods, among which linked-mastoid re-referencing (LMR), average re-referencing 
      (AR) and reference electrode standardization technique (REST). In this study we 
      quantitatively assessed the extent to which the use of a high-density montage and 
      a realistic head model can impact on the optimal estimation of a neutral 
      reference for EEG recordings. APPROACH: Using simulated recordings generated by 
      projecting specific source activity over the sensors, we assessed to what extent 
      AR, REST and LMR may distort the scalp topography. We examined the impact 
      electrode coverage has on AR and REST, and how accurate the REST reconstruction 
      is for realistic and less realistic (three-layer and single-layer spherical) head 
      models, and with possible uncertainty in the electrode positions. We assessed 
      LMR, AR and REST also in the presence of typical EEG artifacts that are mixed in 
      the recordings. Finally, we applied them to real EEG data collected in a target 
      detection experiment to corroborate our findings on simulated data. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Both AR and REST have relatively low reconstruction errors compared to LMR, and 
      that REST is less sensitive than AR and LMR to artifacts mixed in the EEG data. 
      For both AR and REST, high electrode density yields low re-referencing 
      reconstruction errors. A realistic head model is critical for REST, leading to a 
      more accurate estimate of a neutral reference compared to spherical head models. 
      With a low-density montage, REST shows a more reliable reconstruction than AR 
      either with a realistic or a three-layer spherical head model. Conversely, with a 
      high-density montage AR yields better results unless precise information on 
      electrode positions is available. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first to 
      quantitatively assess the performance of EEG re-referencing techniques in 
      relation to the use of a high-density montage and a realistic head model. We hope 
      our study will help researchers in the choice of the most effective 
      re-referencing approach for their EEG studies.

TI  - The effects of spatial filtering and artifacts on electrocorticographic signals.
PG  - 056008
LID - 10.1088/1741-2560/12/5/056008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals contain noise that is common to 
      all channels and noise that is specific to individual channels. Most published 
      ECoG studies use common average reference (CAR) spatial filters to remove common 
      noise, but CAR filters may introduce channel-specific noise into other channels. 
      To address this concern, scientists often remove artifactual channels prior to 
      data analysis. However, removing these channels depends on expert-based labeling 
      and may also discard useful data. Thus, the effects of spatial filtering and 
      artifacts on ECoG signals have been largely unknown. This study aims to quantify 
      these effects and thereby address this gap in knowledge. APPROACH: In this study, 
      we address these issues by exploring the effects of application of two types of 
      unsupervised spatial filters and three methods of detecting signal artifacts 
      using a large ECoG data set (20 subjects, four task conditions in each subject). 
      MAIN RESULTS: Our results confirm that spatial filtering improves performance, 
      i.e., it reduces ECoG signal variance that is not related to the task. They also 
      show that removing artifactual channels automatically (using quantitatively 
      defined rejection criteria) or manually (using expert opinion) does not increase 
      the total amount of task-related information, but does avoid potential 
      contamination from one or more noisy channels. Finally, applying a novel 'median 
      average reference' filter does not require the elimination of artifactual 
      channels prior to spatial filtering and still mitigates the influence of channels 
      with channel-specific noise. Thus, it allows the investigator to retain more 
      potentially useful task-related data. SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, our results show 
      that appropriately designed spatial filters that account for both common noise 
      and channel-specific noise greatly improve the quality of ECoG signal analyses, 
      and that artifacts in only a single channel can result in profound and undesired 
      effects on all other channels.

AB  - Brain oscillations are supposedly crucial for normal cognitive functioning and 
      alterations are associated with cognitive dysfunctions. To demonstrate their 
      causal role on behavior, entrainment approaches in particular aim at driving 
      endogenous oscillations via rhythmic stimulation. Within this context, 
      transcranial electrical stimulation, especially transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation (tACS), has received renewed attention. This is likely due to the 
      possibility of defining oscillatory stimulation properties precisely. Also, 
      measurements comparing pre-tACS with post-tACS electroencephalography (EEG) have 
      shown impressive modulations. However, the period during tACS has remained a 
      blackbox until now, due to the enormous stimulation artifact. By means of 
      application of beamforming to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we successfully 
      recovered modulations of the amplitude of brain oscillations during weak and 
      strong tACS. Additionally, we demonstrate that also evoked responses to visual 
      and auditory stimuli can be recovered during tACS. The main contribution of the 
      present study is to provide critical evidence that during ongoing tACS, subtle 
      modulations of oscillatory brain activity can be reconstructed even at the 
      stimulation frequency. Future tACS experiments will be able to deliver direct 
      physiological insights in order to further the understanding of the contribution 
      of brain oscillations to cognition and behavior.

AB  - Recent studies pinpoint visually cued networks of avalanches with MEG/EEG data. 
      Co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis can be used to detect single brain volume 
      activity profiles and hemodynamic fingerprints of neuronal avalanches as sudden 
      high signal activity peaks in classical fMRI data. In this study, we aimed to 
      detect dynamic patterns of brain activity spreads with the use of ultrafast MR 
      encephalography (MREG). MREG achieves 10 Hz whole brain sampling, allowing the 
      estimation of spatial spread of an avalanche, even with the inherent hemodynamic 
      delay of the BOLD signal. We developed a novel computational method to separate 
      avalanche type fast activity spreads from motion artifacts, vasomotor 
      fluctuations, and cardio-respiratory noise in human brain default mode network 
      (DMN). Reproducible and classical DMN sources were identified using spatial ICA 
      prior to advanced noise removal in order to assure that ICA converges to 
      reproducible networks. Brain activity peaks were identified from parts of the 
      DMN, and normalized MREG data around each peak were extracted individually to 
      show dynamic avalanche type spreads as video clips within the DMN. Individual 
      activity spread video clips of specific parts of the DMN were then averaged over 
      the group of subjects. The experiments show that the high BOLD values around the 
      peaks are mostly spreading along the spatial pattern of the particular DMN 
      segment detected with ICA. With also the spread size and lifetime resembling the 
      expected power law distributions, this indicates that the detected peaks are 
      parts of activity avalanches, starting from (or crossing) the DMN. Furthermore, 
      the split, one-sided sub-networks of the DMN show different spread directions 
      within the same DMN framework. The results open possibilities to follow up brain 
      activity avalanches in the hope to understand more about the system wide 
      properties of diseases related to DMN dysfunction.

TI  - Comparison of Bispectral Index and Entropy values with electroencephalogram 
      during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane.
PG  - 258-66
LID - 10.1093/bja/aev206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concomitantly recorded Bispectral Index® (BIS) and Entropy™ values 
      sometimes show discordant trends during general anaesthesia. Previously, no 
      attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies 
      between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the 
      changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane. 
      METHODS: In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general 
      anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital 
      EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. 
      Whenever BIS and SE values showed ≥10-unit disagreement for ≥60 s, the raw EEG 
      signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain. RESULTS: A ≥10-unit 
      disagreement ≥60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes 
      accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst 
      suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta 
      dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or 
      beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, 
      both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to 
      baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement 
      four times (BIS > SE). CONCLUSIONS: Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, 
      are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain 
      analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, 
      Entropy and other EEG-based indices. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Isolating gait-related movement artifacts in electroencephalography during human 
      walking.
PG  - 046022
LID - 10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide an insight into 
      human brain function during real-world activities with walking. Some recent 
      studies have used EEG to characterize brain activity during walking, but the 
      relative contributions of movement artifact and electrocortical activity have 
      been difficult to quantify. We aimed to characterize movement artifact recorded 
      by EEG electrodes at a range of walking speeds and to test the efficacy of 
      artifact removal methods. We also quantified the similarity between movement 
      artifact recorded by EEG electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer. APPROACH: 
      We used a novel experimental method to isolate and record movement artifact with 
      EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked electrophysiological signals using a 
      nonconductive layer (silicone swim cap) and simulated an electrically conductive 
      scalp on top of the swim cap using a wig coated with conductive gel. We recorded 
      motion artifact EEG data from nine young human subjects walking on a treadmill at 
      speeds from 0.4 to 1.6 m s(-1). We then tested artifact removal methods including 
      moving average and wavelet-based techniques. MAIN RESULTS: Movement artifact 
      recorded with EEG electrodes varied considerably, across speed, subject, and 
      electrode location. The movement artifact measured with EEG electrodes did not 
      correlate well with head acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods 
      attenuated low-frequency noise but did not completely remove movement artifact. 
      The spectral power fluctuations in the movement artifact data resembled data from 
      some previously published studies of EEG during walking. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      results suggest that EEG data recorded during walking likely contains substantial 
      movement artifact that: cannot be explained by head accelerations; varies across 
      speed, subject, and channel; and cannot be removed using traditional signal 
      processing methods. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated methods for 
      removal of EEG movement artifact to advance the field.

TI  - The Fixation Distance to the Stimulus Influences ERP Quality: An EEG and Eye 
      Tracking N400 Study.
PG  - e0134339

LID - e0134339
AB  - In a typical visual Event Related Potential (ERP) study, the stimulus is 
      presented centrally on the screen. Normally an ERP response will be measured 
      provided that the participant directs their gaze towards the stimulus. The aim of 
      this study was to assess how the N400 component of an ERP was affected when the 
      stimulus was presented in the foveal, parafoveal or peripheral vision of the 
      participant's visual field. Utilizing stimuli that have previously produced an 
      N400 response to action incongruities, the same stimuli sequences were presented 
      at 0°, 4°, 8° and 12° of visual angle from a fixation location. In addition to 
      the EEG data, eye tracking data were recorded to act as a fixation control method 
      and to allow for eye artifact detection. The results show a significant N400 
      effect in the right parieto-temporal electrodes within the 0° visual angle 
      condition. For the other conditions, the N400 effect was reduced (4°) or not 
      present (8° and 12°). Our results suggest that the disappearance of the N400 
      effect with eccentricity is due to the fixation distance to the stimulus. 
      However, variables like attentional allocation could have also had an impact on 
      the results. This study highlights the importance of presenting a stimulus within 
      the foveal vision of the participant in order to maximize ERP effects related to 
      higher order cognitive processes.

PG  - 151-6
LID - 10.2174/1874120701509010151 [doi]
AB  - Spikes and sharp waves recorded on scalp EEG may play an important role in 
      identifying the epileptogenic network as well as in understanding the central 
      nervous system. Therefore, several automatic and semi-automatic methods have been 
      implemented to detect these two neural transients. A consistent gold standard 
      associated with a high degree of agreement among neuroscientists is required to 
      measure relevant performance of different methods. In fact, scalp EEG data can 
      often be corrupted by a set of artifacts and are not always served as data of 
      gold standard. For this reason, the use of intracerebral EEG data mixed with 
      gaussian noise seems to best resemble the output of scalp EEG brain and serves as 
      a consistent gold standard. In the present framework, we test the robustness of 
      two important methods that have been previously used for the automatic detection 
      of epileptiform transients (spikes and sharp waves). These methods are based 
      respectively on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform 
      (CWT). Our purpose is to elaborate a comparative study in terms of sensitivity 
      and selectivity changes via the decrease of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which is 
      ranged from 10 dB up to -10 dB. The results demonstrate that, DWT approach turns 
      to be more stable in terms of sensitivity, and it successfully follows the 
      detection of relevant spikes with the decrease of SNR. However, CWT-based 
      approach remains more stable in terms of selectivity, so that, it performs well 
      in terms of rejecting false spikes compared to DWT approach.

      Disease Screening from EEG Signals.

LID - 10.3390/s150817963 [doi]
AB  - A large number of studies have analyzed measurable changes that Alzheimer's 
      disease causes on electroencephalography (EEG). Despite being easily 
      reproducible, those markers have limited sensitivity, which reduces the interest 
      of EEG as a screening tool for this pathology. This is for a large part due to 
      the poor signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals: EEG recordings are indeed usually 
      corrupted by spurious extra-cerebral artifacts. These artifacts are responsible 
      for a consequent degradation of the signal quality. We investigate the 
      possibility to automatically clean a database of EEG recordings taken from 
      patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and healthy age-matched controls. We 
      present here an investigation of commonly used markers of EEG artifacts: 
      kurtosis, sample entropy, zero-crossing rate and fractal dimension. We 
      investigate the reliability of the markers, by comparison with human labeling of 
      sources. Our results show significant differences with the sample entropy marker. 
      We present a strategy for semi-automatic cleaning based on blind source 
      separation, which may improve the specificity of Alzheimer screening using EEG 
      signals.

      Here, subjects watched a 17-min segment from the movie Crash (Lionsgate Films, 
      2004) twice during simultaneous MEG/EEG recordings. Physiological noise 
      components, including ocular and cardiac artifacts, were removed using the 
      DRIFTER algorithm. Dynamic estimates of cortical activity were calculated using 
      MRI-informed minimum-norm estimation. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
      principal component analyses (PCA) were employed to extract the prevailing 
      temporal characteristics within each anatomical parcel of the Freesurfer 
      Desikan-Killiany cortical atlas. A variety of alternative inter-subject 
      correlation (ISC) approaches were then utilized to investigate the reliability of 
      inter-subject synchronization during natural viewing. In the first analysis, the 
      ISCs of the time series of each anatomical region over the full time period 
      across all subject pairs were calculated and averaged. In the second analysis, 
      dynamic ISC (dISC) analysis, the correlation was calculated over a sliding window 
      of 200 ms with 3.3 ms steps. Finally, in a between-run ISC analysis, the 
      between-run correlation was calculated over the dynamic ISCs of the two different 
      runs after the Fisher z-transformation. Overall, the most reliable activations 
      occurred in occipital/inferior temporal visual and superior temporal auditory 
      cortices as well as in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, pre- and post-central 
      gyri, and right inferior and middle frontal gyri. Significant between-run ISCs 
      were observed in superior temporal auditory cortices and inferior temporal visual 
      cortices. Taken together, our results show that movies can be utilized as 
      naturalistic stimuli in MEG/EEG similarly as in fMRI studies.

TI  - Widely applicable MATLAB routines for automated analysis of saccadic reaction 
      times.
PG  - 538-48
LID - 10.3758/s13428-014-0473-z [doi]
AB  - Saccadic reaction time (SRT) is a widely used dependent variable in eye-tracking 
      studies of human cognition and its disorders. SRTs are also frequently measured 
      in studies with special populations, such as infants and young children, who are 
      limited in their ability to follow verbal instructions and remain in a stable 
      position over time. In this article, we describe a library of MATLAB routines 
      (Mathworks, Natick, MA) that are designed to (1) enable completely automated 
      implementation of SRT analysis for multiple data sets and (2) cope with the 
      unique challenges of analyzing SRTs from eye-tracking data collected from poorly 
      cooperating participants. The library includes preprocessing and SRT analysis 
      routines. The preprocessing routines (i.e., moving median filter and 
      interpolation) are designed to remove technical artifacts and missing samples 
      from raw eye-tracking data. The SRTs are detected by a simple algorithm that 
      identifies the last point of gaze in the area of interest, but, critically, the 
      extracted SRTs are further subjected to a number of postanalysis verification 
      checks to exclude values contaminated by artifacts. Example analyses of data from 
      5- to 11-month-old infants demonstrated that SRTs extracted with the proposed 
      routines were in high agreement with SRTs obtained manually from video records, 
      robust against potential sources of artifact, and exhibited moderate to high 
      test-retest stability. We propose that the present library has wide utility in 
      standardizing and automating SRT-based cognitive testing in various populations. 
      The MATLAB routines are open source and can be downloaded from

TI  - Envelope filter sequence to delete blinks and overshoots.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s12938-015-0046-0 [doi]
LID - 48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eye movements have been used in control interfaces and as indicators 
      of somnolence, workload and concentration. Different techniques can be used to 
      detect them: we focus on the electrooculogram (EOG) in which two kinds of 
      interference occur: blinks and overshoots. While they both draw bell-shaped 
      waveforms, blinks are caused by the eyelid, whereas overshoots occur due to 
      target localization error and are placed on saccade. They need to be extracted 
      from the EOG to increase processing effectiveness. METHODS: This paper describes 
      off- and online processing implementations based on lower envelope for removing 
      bell-shaped noise; they are compared with a 300-ms-median filter. Techniques were 
      analyzed using two kinds of EOG data: those modeled from our own design, and real 
      signals. Using a model signal allowed to compare filtered outputs with ideal 
      data, so that it was possible to quantify processing precision to remove noise 
      caused by blinks, overshoots, and general interferences. We analyzed the ability 
      to delete blinks and overshoots, and waveform preservation. RESULTS: Our 
      technique had a high capacity for reducing interference amplitudes (>97%), even 
      exceeding median filter (MF) results. However, the MF obtained better waveform 
      preservation, with a smaller dependence on fixation width. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed technique is better at deleting blinks and overshoots than the MF in 
      model and real EOG signals.

TI  - EEG Single-Trial Detection of Gait Speed Changes during Treadmill Walk.
PG  - e0125479
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0125479 [doi]
LID - e0125479
AB  - In this study, we analyse the electroencephalography (EEG) signal associated with 
      gait speed changes (i.e. acceleration or deceleration). For data acquisition, 
      healthy subjects were asked to perform volitional speed changes between 0, 1, and 
      2 Km/h, during treadmill walk. Simultaneously, the treadmill controller modified 
      the speed of the belt according to the subject's linear speed. A classifier is 
      trained to distinguish between the EEG signal associated with constant speed gait 
      and with gait speed changes, respectively. Results indicate that the 
      classification performance is fair to good for the majority of the subjects, with 
      accuracies always above chance level, in both batch and pseudo-online approaches. 
      Feature visualisation and equivalent dipole localisation suggest that the 
      information used by the classifier is associated with increased activity in 
      parietal areas, where mu and beta rhythms are suppressed during gait speed 
      changes. Specifically, the parietal cortex may be involved in motor planning and 
      visuomotor transformations throughout the online gait adaptation, which is in 
      agreement with previous research. The findings of this study may help to shed 
      light on the cortical involvement in human gait control, and represent a step 
      towards a BMI for applications in post-stroke gait rehabilitation.

AB  - Studying sleep behavior in animal models demands clear separation of vigilance 
      states. Pure manual scoring is time-consuming and commercial scoring software is 
      costly. We present a LabVIEW-based, semi-automated scoring routine using recorded 
      EEG and EMG signals. This scoring routine is •designed to reliably assign the 
      vigilance/sleep states wakefulness (WAKE), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) 
      and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) to defined EEG/EMG episodes.•straightforward 
      to use even for beginners in the field of sleep research.•freely available upon 
      request. Chronic recordings from mice were used to design and evaluate the 
      scoring routine consisting of an artifact-removal, a scoring- and a rescoring 
      routine. The scoring routine processes EMG and different EEG frequency bands. 
      Amplitude-based thresholds for EEG and EMG parameters trigger a decision tree 
      assigning each EEG episode to a defined vigilance/sleep state automatically. 
      Using the rescoring routine individual episodes or particular state transitions 
      can be re-evaluated manually. High agreements between auto-scored and manual 
      sleep scoring could be shown for experienced scorers and for beginners quickly 
      and reliably. With small modifications to the software, it can be easily adapted 
      for sleep analysis in other animal models.

PG  - e1004252

LID - e1004252
AB  - Estimation of the power spectrum is a common method for identifying oscillatory 
      changes in neuronal activity. However, the stochastic nature of neuronal activity 
      leads to severe biases in the estimation of these oscillations in single unit 
      spike trains. Different biological and experimental factors cause the spike train 
      to differentially reflect its underlying oscillatory rate function. We analyzed 
      the effect of factors, such as the mean firing rate and the recording duration, 
      on the detectability of oscillations and their significance, and tested these 
      theoretical results on experimental data recorded in Parkinsonian non-human 
      primates. The effect of these factors is dramatic, such that in some conditions, 
      the detection of existing oscillations is impossible. Moreover, these biases 
      impede the comparison of oscillations across brain regions, neuronal types, 
      behavioral states and separate recordings with different underlying parameters, 
      and lead inevitably to a gross misinterpretation of experimental results. We 
      introduce a novel objective measure, the "modulation index", which overcomes 
      these biases, and enables reliable detection of oscillations from spike trains 
      and a direct estimation of the oscillation magnitude. The modulation index 
      detects a high percentage of oscillations over a wide range of parameters, 
      compared to classical spectral analysis methods, and enables an unbiased 
      comparison between spike trains recorded from different neurons and using 
      different experimental protocols.

TI  - Evaluation of Cerebral Cortex Function in Clients with Bipolar Mood Disorder I 
      (BMD I) Compared With BMD II Using QEEG Analysis.
PG  - 93-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of type I and type II bipolar mood disorder is very 
      challenging particularly in adolescence. Hence, we aimed to investigate the 
      cerebral cortex function in these patients, using quantitative 
      electroencephalography analysis to obtain significant differences between them. 
      METHODS: Thirty- eight adolescents (18 patients with bipolar disorder I and 20 
      with BMD II) participated in this study. We recorded the electroencephalogram 
      signals based on 10-20 international system by 21 electrodes in eyes open and 
      eyes closed condition resting conditions. Forty seconds segments were selected 
      from each recorded signals with minimal noise and artifacts. Periodogram Welch 
      was used to estimate power spectrum density from each segment. Analysis was 
      performed in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma), and we 
      assessed power, mean, entropy, variance and skewness of the spectrums, as well as 
      mean of the thresholded spectrum and thresholded spectrogram. We only used focal 
      montage for comparison. Eventually, data were analyzed by independent 
      Mann-Whitney test and independent t test. RESULTS: We observed significant 
      differences in some brain regions and in all frequency bands. There were 
      significant differences in prefrontal lobe, central lobe, left parietal lobe, 
      occipital lobe and temporal lobe between BMD I and BMD II (P < 0.05). In patients 
      with BMD I, spectral entropy was compared to patients with BMD II. The most 
      significant difference was observed in the gamma frequency band. Also, the power 
      and entropy of delta frequency band was larger in the left parietal lobe in the 
      BMD I patients compared to BMD II patients (P < 0.05). In the temporal lobe, 
      significant differences were observed in the spectrum distribution of beta and 
      gamma frequency bands (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The QEEG and entropy measure are 
      simple and available tools to help detect cerebral cortex deficits and 
      distinguish BMD I from BMD II.

AB  - Artifact rejection is a central issue when dealing with electroencephalogram 
      recordings. Although independent component analysis (ICA) separates data in 
      linearly independent components (IC), the classification of these components as 
      artifact or EEG signal still requires visual inspection by experts. In this 
      paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear discriminant 
      analysis (LDA) for classification of feature vectors extracted from ICA 
      components via image processing algorithms. We compare the performance of this 
      automated classifier to visual classification by experts and identify range 
      filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential for automated IC 
      artifact recognition (accuracy rate 88%). We obtain almost the same level of 
      recognition performance for geometric features and local binary pattern (LBP) 
      features. Compared to the existing automated solutions the proposed method has 
      two main advantages: First, it does not depend on direct recording of artifact 
      signals, which then, e.g. have to be subtracted from the contaminated EEG. 
      Second, it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact. In summary, 
      the present method is an automatic, reliable, real-time capable and practical 
      tool that reduces the time intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact 
      removal. The results are very promising despite the relatively small channel 
      resolution of 25 electrodes.

LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.01.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Binocular rivalry is a perceptual phenomenon that arises when two 
      incompatible images are presented separately, one to each eye, and the observer 
      experiences involuntary perceptual alternations between the two images. If the 
      two images are flickering at two distinct frequencies, electroencephalography 
      (EEG) can be used to track the frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked 
      potential (SSVEP) driven by each image as they compete for awareness, providing 
      an objective measure of the subjective perceptual state. This spontaneous 
      alternation in perceptual dominance is believed to be driven by neural processes 
      across widespread regions in the brain, but the real-time mechanisms of these 
      processes remain unclear. NEW METHOD: The goal of this study was to determine the 
      feasibility of investigating binocular rivalry using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      approach in order to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high 
      spatial resolution of fMRI. RESULTS: We have developed novel techniques for 
      artifact removal and signal optimization for the rivalry-related SSVEP data 
      collected simultaneously during fMRI. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our 
      methods address several significant technical challenges of recording SSVEP data 
      in the noisy fMRI environment, and enabled us to successfully reconstruct SSVEP 
      signatures of rivalry in a group of healthy human subjects. CONCLUSION: Further 
      development and application of these techniques will enable more comprehensive 
      integration of EEG and fMRI data collected simultaneously and could have 
      significant implications for EEG-fMRI studies of brain activity in general.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polysomnography (PSG) is treated as the gold standard for diagnosing 
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, it is labor-intensive, time-consuming, 
      and expensive. This study evaluates validity of overnight pulse oximetry as a 
      diagnostic tool for moderate to severe OSA patients. METHODS: A total of 699 
      patients with possible OSA were recruited for overnight oximetry and PSG 
      examination at the Sleep Center of a University Hospital from Jan. 2004 to Dec. 
      2005. By excluding 23 patients with poor oximetry recording, poor EEG signals, or 
      respiratory artifacts resulting in a total recording time less than 3 hours; 12 
      patients with total sleeping time (TST) less than 1 hour, possibly because of 
      insomnia; and 48 patients whose ages less than 20 or more than 85 years old, data 
      of 616 patients were used for further study. By further considering 76 patients 
      with TST < 4 h, a group of 540 patients with TST ≥ 4 h was used to study the 
      effect of insufficient sleeping time. Alice 4 PSG recorder (Respironics Inc., 
      USA) was used to monitor patients with suspected OSA and to record their PSG 
      data. After statistical analysis and feature selection, models built based on 
      support vector machine (SVM) were then used to diagnose moderate and moderate to 
      severe OSA patients with a threshold of AHI = 30 and AHI = 15, respectively. 
      RESULTS: The SVM models designed based on the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index 
      (ODI) derived from oximetry measurements provided an accuracy of 90.42-90.55%, a 
      sensitivity of 89.36-89.87%, a specificity of 91.08-93.05%, and an area under ROC 
      curve (AUC) of 0.953-0.957 for the diagnosis of severe OSA patients; as well as 
      achieved an accuracy of 87.33-87.77%, a sensitivity of 87.71-88.53%, a 
      specificity of 86.38-86.56%, and an AUC of 0.921-0.924 for the diagnosis of 
      moderate to severe OSA patients. The predictive outcome of ODI to diagnose severe 
      OSA patients is better than to diagnose moderate to severe OSA patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overnight pulse oximetry provides satisfactory diagnostic 
      performance in detecting severe OSA patients. Home-styled oximetry may be a tool 
      for severe OSA diagnosis.

      Reconstruction from MRI.

AB  - Improving EEG signal interpretation, specificity, and sensitivity is a primary 
      focus of many current investigations, and the successful application of EEG 
      signal processing methods requires a detailed knowledge of both the topography 
      and frequency spectra of low-amplitude, high-frequency craniofacial EMG. This 
      information remains limited in clinical research, and as such, there is no known 
      reliable technique for the removal of these artifacts from EEG data. The results 
      presented herein outline a preliminary investigation of craniofacial EMG 
      high-frequency spectra and 3D MRI segmentation that offers insight into the 
      development of an anatomically-realistic model for characterizing these effects. 
      The data presented highlights the potential for confounding signal contribution 
      from around 60 to 200 Hz, when observed in frequency space, from both low and 
      high-amplitude EMG signals. This range directly overlaps that of both low Î³ 
      (30-50 Hz) and high Î³ (50-80 Hz) waves, as defined traditionally in standatrd 
      EEG measurements, and mainly with waves presented in dense-array EEG recordings. 
      Likewise, average EMG amplitude comparisons from each condition highlights the 
      similarities in signal contribution of low-activity muscular movements and 
      resting, control conditions. In addition to the FFT analysis performed, 3D 
      segmentation and reconstruction of the craniofacial muscles whose EMG signals 
      were measured was successful. This recapitulation of the relevant EMG morphology 
      is a crucial first step in developing an anatomical model for the isolation and 
      removal of confounding low-amplitude craniofacial EMG signals from EEG data. Such 
      a model may be eventually applied in a clinical setting to ultimately help to 
      extend the use of EEG in various clinical roles.

TI  - Physiologic artifacts in resting state oscillations in young children: 
      methodological considerations for noisy data.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1007/s11682-014-9343-7 [doi]
AB  - We quantified the potential effects of physiologic artifact on the estimation of 
      EEG band power in a cohort of typically developing children in order to guide 
      artifact rejection methods in quantitative EEG data analysis in developmental 
      populations. High density EEG was recorded for 2 min while children, ages 2-6, 
      watched a video of bubbles. Segments of data were categorized as blinks, 
      saccades, EMG or artifact-free, and both absolute and relative power in the theta 
      (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (35-45 Hz) bands were 
      calculated in 9 regions for each category. Using a linear mixed model approach 
      with artifact type, region and their interaction as predictors, we compared mean 
      band power between clean data and each type of artifact. We found significant 
      differences in mean relative and absolute power between artifacts and 
      artifact-free segments in all frequency bands. The magnitude and direction of the 
      differences varied based on power type, region, and frequency band. The most 
      significant differences in mean band power were found in the gamma band for EMG 
      artifact and the theta band for ocular artifacts. Artifact detection strategies 
      need to be sensitive to the oscillations of interest for a given analysis, with 
      the most conservative approach being the removal of all EMG and ocular artifact 
      from EEG data. Quantitative EEG holds considerable promise as a clinical 
      biomarker of both typical and atypical development. However, there needs to be 
      transparency in the choice of power type, regions of interest, and frequency 
      band, as each of these variables are differentially vulnerable to noise, and 
      therefore, their interpretation depends on the methods used to identify and 
      remove artifacts.

AB  - Application of neuro-augmentation technology based on dry-wireless EEG may be 
      considerably beneficial for aviation and space operations because of the inherent 
      dangers involved. In this study we evaluate classification performance of 
      perceptual events using a dry-wireless EEG system during motion platform based 
      flight simulation and actual flight in an open cockpit biplane to determine if 
      the system can be used in the presence of considerable environmental and 
      physiological artifacts. A passive task involving 200 random auditory 
      presentations of a chirp sound was used for evaluation. The advantage of this 
      auditory task is that it does not interfere with the perceptual motor processes 
      involved with piloting the plane. Classification was based on identifying the 
      presentation of a chirp sound vs. silent periods. Evaluation of Independent 
      component analysis (ICA) and Kalman filtering to enhance classification 
      performance by extracting brain activity related to the auditory event from other 
      non-task related brain activity and artifacts was assessed. The results of 
      permutation testing revealed that single trial classification of presence or 
      absence of an auditory event was significantly above chance for all conditions on 
      a novel test set. The best performance could be achieved with both ICA and Kalman 
      filtering relative to no processing: Platform Off (83.4% vs. 78.3%), Platform On 
      (73.1% vs. 71.6%), Biplane Engine Off (81.1% vs. 77.4%), and Biplane Engine On 
      (79.2% vs. 66.1%). This experiment demonstrates that dry-wireless EEG can be used 
      in environments with considerable vibration, wind, acoustic noise, and 
      physiological artifacts and achieve good single trial classification performance 
      that is necessary for future successful application of neuro-augmentation 
      technology based on brain-machine interfaces.

TI  - Monitoring depth of anesthesia using combination of EEG measure and hemodynamic 
      variables.
PG  - 41-51
LID - 10.1007/s11571-014-9295-z [doi]
AB  - Monitoring depth of anesthesia (DOA) via vital signs is a major ongoing challenge 
      for anesthetists. A number of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors such as 
      the Bispectral (BIS) index have been proposed. However, anesthesia is related to 
      central and autonomic nervous system functions whereas the EEG signal originates 
      only from the central nervous system. This paper proposes an automated DOA 
      detection system which consists of three steps. Initially, we introduce 
      multiscale modified permutation entropy index which is robust in the 
      characterization of the burst suppression pattern and combine multiscale 
      information. This index quantifies the amount of complexity in EEG data and is 
      computationally efficient, conceptually simple and artifact resistant. Then, 
      autonomic nervous system activity is quantified with heart rate and mean arterial 
      pressure which are easily acquired using routine monitoring machine. Finally, the 
      extracted features are used as input to a linear discriminate analyzer (LDA). The 
      method is validated with data obtained from 25 patients during the cardiac 
      surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. The experimental results indicate that 
      an overall accuracy of 89.4 % can be obtained using combination of EEG measure 
      and hemodynamic variables, together with LDA to classify the vital sign into 
      awake, light, surgical and deep anesthetised states. The results demonstrate that 
      the proposed method can estimate DOA more effectively than the commercial BIS 
      index with a stronger artifact-resistance.

AB  - Impairment of an individual's ability to communicate is a major hurdle for active 
      participation in education and social life. A lot of individuals with cerebral 
      palsy (CP) have normal intelligence, however, due to their inability to 
      communicate, they fall behind. Non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based 
      brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed as potential assistive 
      devices for individuals with CP. BCIs translate brain signals directly into 
      action. Motor activity is no longer required. However, translation of EEG signals 
      may be unreliable and requires months of training. Moreover, individuals with CP 
      may exhibit high levels of spontaneous and uncontrolled movement, which has a 
      large impact on EEG signal quality and results in incorrect translations. We 
      introduce a novel thought-based row-column scanning communication board that was 
      developed following user-centered design principles. Key features include an 
      automatic online artifact reduction method and an evidence accumulation procedure 
      for decision making. The latter allows robust decision making with unreliable BCI 
      input. Fourteen users with CP participated in a supporting online study and 
      helped to evaluate the performance of the developed system. Users were asked to 
      select target items with the row-column scanning communication board. The results 
      suggest that seven among eleven remaining users performed better than chance and 
      were consequently able to communicate by using the developed system. Three users 
      were excluded because of insufficient EEG signal quality. These results are very 
      encouraging and represent a good foundation for the development of real-world 
      BCI-based communication devices for users with CP.

PG  - 169-81
LID - 10.1111/psyp.12320 [doi]
AB  - A companion paper introduced the rERP framework, which recasts traditional 
      event-related potential (ERP) averaging as a special case of a more flexible 
      regression-based approach to estimating ERP waveforms. Here, we build on this 
      foundation, showing how rERP analysis can also handle the estimation of nonlinear 
      effects (a generalization of both the well-known approach of dichotomizing 
      continuous covariates, and also of the ERP image technique), and can disentangle 
      overlapping ERPs to temporally adjacent stimuli. We then consider how the use of 
      rERPs impacts on other parts of the EEG analysis pipeline, including baselining, 
      filtering, significance testing, and artifact rejection, and provide practical 
      recommendations. Free software implementing these techniques is available.

      framework, which extends ERP averaging to handle arbitrary combinations of 
      categorical and continuous covariates, partial confounding, nonlinear effects, 
      and overlapping responses to distinct events, all within a single unified system. 
      rERPs enable a richer variety of paradigms (including high-N naturalistic 
      designs) while preserving the advantages of traditional ERPs. This article 
      provides an accessible introduction to what rERPs are, why they are useful, how 
      they are computed, and when we should expect them to be effective, particularly 
      in cases of partial confounding. A companion article discusses how nonlinear 
      effects and overlap correction can be handled within this framework, as well as 
      practical considerations around baselining, filtering, statistical testing, and 
      artifact rejection. Free software implementing these techniques is available.

AB  - A number of electroencephalography (EEG) studies have investigated the time 
      course of brain activation during overt word production. The interpretation of 
      their results is complicated by the fact that articulatory movements may mask the 
      cognitive components of interest. The first aim of the present study was to 
      investigate when speech artifacts occur during word production planning and what 
      effects they have on the spatio-temporal neural activation pattern. The second 
      aim was to propose a new method that strongly attenuates speech artifacts during 
      overt picture naming and to compare it with existing methods. EEG and surface 
      electromyograms (EMGs) of the lips were recorded while participants overtly named 
      pictures in a picture-word interference paradigm. The comparison of the raw data 
      with lip EMG and the comparison of source localizations of raw and corrected EEG 
      data showed that speech artifacts occurred mainly from ~400 ms post-stimulus 
      onset, but some earlier artifacts mean that they occur much earlier than hitherto 
      assumed. We compared previously used methods of speech artifacts removal (SAR) 
      with a new method, which is based on Independent Component Analysis (SAR-ICA). 
      Our new method clearly outperformed other methods. In contrast to other methods, 
      there was only a weak correlation between the lip EMG and the corrected data by 
      SAR-ICA. Also, only the data corrected with our method showed activation of 
      cerebral sources consistent with meta-analyses of word production.

TI  - Constructing Carbon Fiber Motion-Detection Loops for Simultaneous EEG-fMRI.
PG  - 260
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2014.00260 [doi]
LID - 260
AB  - One of the most significant impediments to high-quality EEG recorded in an MRI 
      scanner is subject motion. Availability of motion artifact sensors can 
      substantially improve the quality of the recorded EEG. In the study of epilepsy, 
      it can also dramatically increase the confidence that one has in discriminating 
      true epileptiform activity from artifact. This is due both to the reduction in 
      artifact and the ability to visually inspect the motion sensor signals when 
      reading the EEG, revealing whether or not head motion is present. We have 
      previously described the use of carbon fiber loops for detecting and correcting 
      artifact in EEG acquired simultaneously with MRI. The loops, attached to the 
      subject's head, are electrically insulated from the scalp. They provide a simple 
      and direct measure of specific artifact that is contaminating the EEG, including 
      both subject motion and residual artifact arising from magnetic field gradients 
      applied during MRI. Our previous implementation was used together with a 
      custom-built EEG-fMRI system that differs substantially from current commercially 
      available EEG-fMRI systems. The present technical note extends this work, 
      describing in more detail how to construct the carbon fiber motion-detection 
      loops, and how to interface them with a commercially available simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI system. We hope that the information provided may help those wishing to 
      utilize a motion-detection/correction solution to improve the quality of EEG 
      recorded within an MRI scanner.

      in Humans.

LID - 10.1159/000382023 [doi]
AB  - Gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) in the brain are involved in attention, perception 
      and memory. They are altered in various pathological states, as well as by 
      neuropharmaceuticals, so that they are of interest in drug and clinical 
      investigations. However, when the human electroencephalogram is recorded on the 
      scalp, this neural high-frequency signal is buried under a range of other 
      electrical signals such that, without careful handling, recordings of the 
      high-frequency electroencephalogram cannot be considered reliable. The artefacts 
      of concern originate from: power line noise, saccade-associated contraction of 
      the extra-ocular muscles, activity of muscles in the scalp, face and neck, screen 
      refresh artefacts and activity of the muscles associated with blinking. Recent 
      progress in dealing with these artefacts is described, including either noise 
      cancellation or phased noise template subtraction for power line noise, 
      regression or independent component analysis for correcting extra-ocular muscle 
      activity and mathematical modelling for reducing scalp, face and neck muscle 
      activity. If the artefacts are properly addressed, the neural gamma signal can be 
      uncovered.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320216 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals present a myriad of challenges to analysis, 
      beginning with the detection of artifacts. Prior approaches to noise detection 
      have utilized multiple techniques, including visual methods, independent 
      component analysis and wavelets. However, no single method is broadly accepted, 
      inviting alternative ways to address this problem. Here, we introduce a novel 
      approach based on a statistical physics method, multiscale entropy (MSE) 
      analysis, which quantifies the complexity of a signal. We postulate that noise 
      corrupted EEG signals have lower information content, and, therefore, reduced 
      complexity compared with their noise free counterparts. We test the new method on 
      an open-access database of EEG signals with and without added artifacts due to 
      electrode motion.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320036 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of dry electrodes for EEG measurements has opened up 
      possibilities of recording EEG outside of standard clinical environments by 
      reducing required preparation and maintenance. However, the signal quality of dry 
      electrodes in comparison with wet electrodes has not yet been evaluated under 
      activities of daily life (ADL) or high motion tasks. In this study, we compared 
      the performances of foam-based and spring-loaded dry electrodes with wet 
      electrodes under three different task conditions: resting state, walking, and 
      cycling. Our analysis showed that signals obtained by the 2 types of dry 
      electrodes and obtained by wet electrodes displayed high correlation for all 
      conditions, while being prone to similar environmental and electrode-based 
      artifacts. Overall, our results suggest that dry electrodes have a similar signal 
      quality in comparison to wet electrodes during motion and may be more practical 
      for use in mobile and real-time motion applications due to their convenience. In 
      addition, we conclude that as with wet electrodes, post-processing can mitigate 
      motion artifacts in ambulatory EEG acquisition.

AB  - Rapid eye movements (REMs) are a peculiar and intriguing aspect of REM sleep, 
      even if their physiological function still remains unclear. During this work, a 
      new automatic tool was developed, aimed at a complete description of REMs 
      activity during the night, both in terms of their timing of occurrence that in 
      term of their directional properties. A classification stage of each singular 
      movement detected during the night according to its main direction, was in fact 
      added to our procedure of REMs detection and ocular artifact removal. A 
      supervised classifier was constructed, using as training and validation set EOG 
      data recorded during voluntary saccades of five healthy volunteers. Different 
      classification methods were tested and compared. The further information about 
      REMs directional characteristic provided by the procedure would represent a 
      valuable tool for a deeper investigation into REMs physiological origin and 
      functional meaning.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) is susceptible to various nonneural physiological 
      artifacts. Automatic artifact removal from EEG data remains a key challenge for 
      extracting relevant information from brain activities. To adapt to variable 
      subjects and EEG acquisition environments, this paper presents an automatic 
      online artifact removal method based on a priori artifact information. The 
      combination of discrete wavelet transform and independent component analysis 
      (ICA), wavelet-ICA, was utilized to separate artifact components. The artifact 
      components were then automatically identified using a priori artifact 
      information, which was acquired in advance. Subsequently, signal reconstruction 
      without artifact components was performed to obtain artifact-free signals. The 
      results showed that, using this automatic online artifact removal method, there 
      were statistical significant improvements of the classification accuracies in 
      both two experiments, namely, motor imagery and emotion recognition.

TI  - On the cerebral origin of EEG responses to TMS: insights from severe cortical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with 
      electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) represents a valuable tool to probe cortical 
      excitability and connectivity. Although several procedures have been devised to 
      abolish TMS-related artifacts, direct evidence that it is possible to record 
      TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) that purely reflect cortical responses to TMS are 
      still lacking. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that when TMS is delivered on a human 
      head with intact nerves, scalp and ocular muscles, TEPs are present only if a 
      functional portion of cortex is targeted and is absent otherwise. METHODS: We 
      performed extensive navigated TMS/EEG mappings in three vegetative state patients 
      and in eight healthy controls. Patients were selected based on the extension of 
      their cortical lesions as revealed by structural/functional imaging: the cerebral 
      cortex was globally damaged in Patient 1 due to cerebral anoxia, Patient 2 showed 
      a traumatic damage affecting one cerebral hemisphere, while Patient 3 was 
      characterized by one left sided and one right-sided focal ischemic lesion. 
      RESULTS: In Patient 1, TMS performed at any targeted cortical site did not elicit 
      statistically significant TEPs. In Patient 2, TEPs were absent when the damaged 
      hemisphere was targeted, while were present over the healthy side. In Patient 3, 
      significant TEPs were absent when cortical lesions were targeted and present 
      otherwise. Significant TEPs were always present in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that, provided that appropriate experimental procedures 
      are employed, TEPs are genuine cortical responses detectable only when preserved 
      cortical tissue is stimulated. Hence, a dependable assessment of cortical 
      excitability and connectivity in brain-injured patients requires the use of 
      neuronavigated TMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) allow direct translation of electric, 
      magnetic or metabolic brain signals into control commands of external devices 
      such as robots, prostheses or exoskeletons. However, non-stationarity of brain 
      signals and susceptibility to biological or environmental artifacts impede 
      reliable control and safety of BMIs, particularly in daily life environments. 
      Here we introduce and tested a novel hybrid brain-neural computer interaction 
      (BNCI) system fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) to 
      enhance reliability and safety of continuous hand exoskeleton-driven grasping 
      motions. FINDINGS: 12 healthy volunteers (8 male, mean age 28.1 ± 3.63y) used EEG 
      (condition #1) and hybrid EEG/EOG (condition #2) signals to control a hand 
      exoskeleton. Motor imagery-related brain activity was translated into 
      exoskeleton-driven hand closing motions. Unintended motions could be interrupted 
      by eye movement-related EOG signals. In order to evaluate BNCI control and 
      safety, participants were instructed to follow a visual cue indicating either to 
      move or not to move the hand exoskeleton in a random order. Movements exceeding 
      25% of a full grasping motion when the device was not supposed to be moved were 
      defined as safety violation. While participants reached comparable control under 
      both conditions, safety was frequently violated under condition #1 (EEG), but not 
      under condition #2 (EEG/EOG). CONCLUSION: EEG/EOG biosignal fusion can 
      substantially enhance safety of assistive BNCI systems improving their 
      applicability in daily life environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The event-related potentials technique is widely used in cognitive 
      neuroscience research. The P300 waveform has been explored in many research 
      articles because of its wide applications, such as lie detection or 
      brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, very few datasets are publicly 
      available. Therefore, most researchers use only their private datasets for their 
      analysis. This leads to minimally comparable results, particularly in 
      brain-computer research interfaces. Here we present 
      electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) data. The data were 
      obtained from 20 healthy subjects and was acquired using an odd-ball hardware 
      stimulator. The visual stimulation was based on a three-stimulus paradigm and 
      included target, non-target and distracter stimuli. The data and collected 
      metadata are shared in the EEG/ERP Portal. FINDINGS: The paper also describes the 
      process and validation results of the presented data. The data were validated 
      using two different methods. The first method evaluated the data by measuring the 
      percentage of artifacts. The second method tested if the expectation of the 
      experimental results was fulfilled (i.e., if the target trials contained the P300 
      component). The validation proved that most datasets were suitable for subsequent 
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presented datasets together with their metadata 
      provide researchers with an opportunity to study the P300 component from 
      different perspectives. Furthermore, they can be used for BCI research.

AB  - Low frequency signals recorded from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), in 
      particular movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs), are associated with 
      preparation and execution of movement and thus present a target for use in 
      brain-machine interfaces. We investigated the ability to decode movement intent 
      from delta-band (0.1-4 Hz) EEG recorded immediately before movement execution in 
      healthy volunteers. We used data from epochs starting 1.5 s before movement onset 
      to classify future movements into one of three classes: stand-up, sit-down, or 
      quiet. We assessed classification accuracy in both externally triggered and 
      self-paced paradigms. Movement onset was determined from electromyography (EMG) 
      recordings synchronized with EEG signals. We employed an artifact subspace 
      reconstruction (ASR) algorithm to eliminate high amplitude noise before building 
      our time-embedded EEG features. We applied local Fisher's discriminant analysis 
      to reduce the dimensionality of our spatio-temporal features and subsequently 
      used a Gaussian mixture model classifier for our three class problem. Our results 
      demonstrate significantly better than chance classification accuracy (chance 
      level = 33.3%) for the self-initiated (78.0 ± 2.6%) and triggered (74.7 ± 5.7%) 
      paradigms. Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in classification 
      accuracy between the self-paced and cued paradigms when using the full set of 
      non-peripheral electrodes. However, accuracy was significantly increased for 
      self-paced movements when only electrodes over the primary motor area were used. 
      Overall, this study demonstrates that delta-band EEG recorded immediately before 
      movement carries discriminative information regarding movement type. Our results 
      suggest that EEG-based classifiers could improve lower-limb neuroprostheses and 
      neurorehabilitation techniques by providing earlier detection of movement intent, 
      which could be used in robot-assisted strategies for motor training and recovery 
      of function.

AB  - Non-invasive Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) are being used more and more these 
      days to design systems focused on helping people with motor disabilities. 
      Spontaneous BMIs translate user's brain signals into commands to control devices. 
      On these systems, by and large, 2 different mental tasks can be detected with 
      enough accuracy. However, a large training time is required and the system needs 
      to be adjusted on each session. This paper presents a supplementary system that 
      employs BMI sensors, allowing the use of 2 systems (the BMI system and the 
      supplementary system) with the same data acquisition device. This supplementary 
      system is designed to control a robotic arm in two dimensions using 
      electromyographical (EMG) signals extracted from the electroencephalographical 
      (EEG) recordings. These signals are voluntarily produced by users clenching their 
      jaws. EEG signals (with EMG contributions) were registered and analyzed to obtain 
      the electrodes and the range of frequencies which provide the best classification 
      results for 5 different clenching tasks. A training stage, based on the 
      2-dimensional control of a cursor, was designed and used by the volunteers to get 
      used to this control. Afterwards, the control was extrapolated to a robotic arm 
      in a 2-dimensional workspace. Although the training performed by volunteers 
      requires 70 minutes, the final results suggest that in a shorter period of time 
      (45 min), users should be able to control the robotic arm in 2 dimensions with 
      their jaws. The designed system is compared with a similar 2-dimensional system 
      based on spontaneous BMIs, and our system shows faster and more accurate 
      performance. This is due to the nature of the control signals. Brain potentials 
      are much more difficult to control than the electromyographical signals produced 
      by jaw clenches. Additionally, the presented system also shows an improvement in 
      the results compared with an electrooculographic system in a similar environment.

TI  - Removal of pulse artefact from EEG data recorded in MR environment at 3T. Setting 
      of ICA parameters for marking artefactual components: application to 
      resting-state data.

AB  - Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) allow for a non-invasive investigation of cerebral functions with 
      high temporal and spatial resolution. The main challenge of such integration is 
      the removal of the pulse artefact (PA) that affects EEG signals recorded in the 
      magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Often applied techniques for this purpose are 
      Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The combination 
      of OBS and ICA is increasingly used, since it can potentially improve the 
      correction performed by each technique separately. The present study is focused 
      on the OBS-ICA combination and is aimed at providing the optimal ICA parameters 
      for PA correction in resting-state EEG data, where the information of interest is 
      not specified in latency and amplitude as in, for example, evoked potential. A 
      comparison between two intervals for ICA calculation and four methods for marking 
      artefactual components was performed. The performance of the methods was 
      discussed in terms of their capability to 1) remove the artefact and 2) preserve 
      the information of interest. The analysis included 12 subjects and two 
      resting-state datasets for each of them. The results showed that none of the 
      signal lengths for the ICA calculation was highly preferable to the other. Among 
      the methods for the identification of PA-related components, the one based on the 
      wavelets transform of each component emerged as the best compromise between the 
      effectiveness in removing PA and the conservation of the physiological neuronal 
      content.

TI  - Quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) Spectrum Analysis of Patients with 
      Schizoaffective Disorder Compared to Normal Subjects.
PG  - 216-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to achieve a better understanding of 
      schizoaffective disorder. Therefore, we obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      signals from patients with schizoaffective disorder and analyzed them in 
      comparison to normal subjects. METHOD: Forty patients with schizoaffective 
      disorder and 40 normal subjects were selected randomly and their 
      electroencephalogram signals were recorded based on 10-20 international system by 
      23 electrodes in open- and closed-eyes while they were sitting on a chair 
      comfortably. After preprocessing for noise removal and artifact reduction, we 
      took 60- second segments from each recorded signals. Then, the absolute and 
      relative powers of these segments were evaluated in all channels and in 4 
      frequency bands (i.e., delta, theta, alpha and beta waves). Finally, Data were 
      analyzed by independent t-test using SPSS software. RESULTS: A significant 
      decrease in relative power in the alpha band, a significant decrease in power 
      spectra in the alpha band and a significant increase in power spectra in the beta 
      band were found in patients compared to normal subjects (P < 0.05). The 
      predominant wave in the centro-parietal region was the beta wave in patients, but 
      it was the alpha band in normal subjects (P = 0.048). Also, the predominant wave 
      of the occipital region in patients was the delta wave, while it was the alpha 
      wave in normal subjects (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Considering the findings, 
      particularly based on the significant decrease of the alpha waves in 
      schizoaffective patients, it can be concluded that schizoaffective disorder can 
      be seen in schizophrenia spectrum.

TI  - A preliminary study of muscular artifact cancellation in single-channel EEG.
PG  - 18370-89
LID - 10.3390/s141018370 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscular 
      artifacts that strongly obscure the EEG signals and complicates their analysis. 
      For the conventional case, where the EEG recordings are obtained simultaneously 
      over many EEG channels, there exists a considerable range of methods for removing 
      muscular artifacts. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend to use 
      EEG information in ambulatory healthcare and related physiological signal 
      monitoring systems. For practical reasons, a single EEG channel system must be 
      used in these situations. Unfortunately, there exist few studies for muscular 
      artifact cancellation in single-channel EEG recordings. To address this issue, in 
      this preliminary study, we propose a simple, yet effective, method to achieve the 
      muscular artifact cancellation for the single-channel EEG case. This method is a 
      combination of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the joint 
      blind source separation (JBSS) techniques. We also conduct a study that compares 
      and investigates all possible single-channel solutions and demonstrate the 
      performance of these methods using numerical simulations and real-life 
      applications. The proposed method is shown to significantly outperform all other 
      methods. It can successfully remove muscular artifacts without altering the 
      underlying EEG activity. It is thus a promising tool for use in ambulatory 
      healthcare systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The electroencephalogram (EEG) remains the primary tool for diagnosis 
      of abnormal brain activity in clinical neurology and for in vivo recordings of 
      human neurophysiology in neuroscience research. In EEG data acquisition, voltage 
      is measured at positions on the scalp with respect to a reference electrode. When 
      this reference electrode responds to electrical activity or artifact all 
      electrodes are affected. Successful analysis of EEG data often involves 
      re-referencing procedures that modify the recorded traces and seek to minimize 
      the impact of reference electrode activity upon functions of the original EEG 
      recordings. NEW METHOD: We provide a novel, statistically robust procedure that 
      adapts a robust maximum-likelihood type estimator to the problem of reference 
      estimation, reduces the influence of neural activity from the re-referencing 
      operation, and maintains good performance in a wide variety of empirical 
      scenarios. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed and existing re-referencing 
      procedures are validated in simulation and with examples of EEG recordings. To 
      facilitate this comparison, channel-to-channel correlations are investigated 
      theoretically and in simulation. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed 
      procedure avoids using data contaminated by neural signal and remains unbiased in 
      recording scenarios where physical references, the common average reference (CAR) 
      and the reference estimation standardization technique (REST) are not optimal. 
      CONCLUSION: The proposed procedure is simple, fast, and avoids the potential for 
      substantial bias when analyzing low-density EEG data.

TI  - De-noising with a SOCK can improve the performance of event-related ICA.
PG  - 285
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2014.00285 [doi]
LID - 285
AB  - Event-related ICA (eICA) is a partially data-driven analysis method for 
      event-related fMRI that is particularly suited to analysis of simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI of patients with epilepsy. EEG-fMRI studies in epileptic patients are 
      typically analyzed using the general linear model (GLM), often with assumption 
      that the onset and offset of neuronal activity match EEG event onset and offset, 
      the neuronal activation is sustained at a constant level throughout the 
      epileptiform event and that associated fMRI signal changes follow the canonical 
      HRF. The eICA method allows for less constrained analyses capable of detecting 
      early, non-canonical responses. A key step of eICA is the initial deconvolution 
      which can be confounded by various sources of structured noise present in the 
      fMRI signal. To help overcome this, we have extend the eICA procedure by 
      utilizing a fully standalone and automated fMRI de-noising procedure to process 
      the fMRI data from an EEG-fMRI acquisition prior to running eICA. Specifically we 
      first apply ICA to the entire fMRI time-series and use a classifier to remove 
      noise-related components. The automated objective de-noiser, "Spatially Organized 
      Component Klassificator" (SOCK) is used; it has previously been shown to 
      distinguish a substantial fraction of noise from true activation, without 
      rejecting the latter, in resting-state fMRI. A second ICA is then performed, this 
      time on the event-related response estimates derived from the denoised data 
      (according to the usual eICA procedure). We hypothesize that SOCK + eICA has the 
      potential to be more sensitive than eICA alone. We test the effectiveness of SOCK 
      by comparing activation obtained in an eICA analysis of EEG-fMRI data with and 
      without the use of SOCK for 14 patients with rolandic epilepsy who exhibited 
      stereotypical IEDs arising from a focus in the rolandic fissure.

AB  - Non-invasive assessment of ventilatory control stability or loop gain (which is a 
      key contributor in a number of sleep-related breathing disorders) has proven to 
      be cumbersome. We present a novel multivariate autoregressive model that we 
      hypothesize will enable us to make time-varying measurements of loop gain using 
      nothing more than spontaneous fluctuations in ventilation and CO2. The model is 
      adaptive to changes in the feedback control loop and therefore can account for 
      system non-stationarities (e.g. changes in sleep state) and it is resistant to 
      artifacts by using a signal quality measure. We tested this method by assessing 
      its ability to detect a known increase in loop gain induced by proportional 
      assist ventilation (PAV). Subjects were studied during sleep while breathing on 
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone (to stabilize the airway) or on 
      CPAP+PAV. We show that the method tracked the PAV-induced increase in loop gain, 
      demonstrating its time-varying capabilities, and it remained accurate in the face 
      of measurement related artifacts. The model was able to detect a statistically 
      significant increase in loop gain from 0.14±10 on CPAP alone to 0.21±0.13 on 
      CPAP+PAV (p<0.05). Furthermore, our method correctly detected that the 
      PAV-induced increase in loop gain was predominantly driven by an increase in 
      controller gain. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence for the 
      validity of this technique.

AB  - Presurgical monitoring with intracerebral electrodes in patients with 
      drug-resistant focal epilepsy represents a standard invasive procedure to 
      localize the sites of seizures origin, defined as the epileptogenic zone (EZ). 
      During presurgical evaluation, intracerebral single-pulse electrical stimulation 
      (SPES) is performed to define the boundaries of eloquent areas and to evoke 
      seizure-associated symptoms. Extensive intracranial exploration and stimulation 
      generate a large dataset on brain connectivity that can be used to improve EZ 
      detection and to understand the organization of the human epileptic brain. We 
      developed a protocol to analyse field responses evoked by intracranial 
      stimulation. Intracerebral recordings were performed with 105-162 recording sites 
      positioned in fronto-temporal regions in 12 patients with pharmacoresistant focal 
      epilepsy. Recording sites were used for bipolar SPES at 1 Hz. Reproducible early 
      and late phases (<60 ms and 60-500 ms from stimulus artefact, respectively) were 
      identified on averaged evoked responses. Phase 1 and 2 responses recorded at all 
      and each recording sites were plotted on a 3D brain reconstructions. Based on 
      connectivity properties, electrode contacts were primarily identified as 
      receivers, mainly activators or bidirectional. We used connectivity patterns to 
      construct networks and applied cluster partitioning to study the proprieties 
      between potentials evoked/stimulated in different regions. We demonstrate that 
      bidirectional connectivity during phase 1 is a prevalent feature that 
      characterize contacts included in the EZ. This study shows that the application 
      of an analytical protocol on intracerebral stimulus-evoked recordings provides 
      useful information that may contribute to EZ detection and to the management of 
      surgical-remediable epilepsies.

TI  - A graphical user interface for infant ERP analysis.
PG  - 745-57
LID - 10.3758/s13428-013-0404-4 [doi]
AB  - Recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) is one of the best-suited 
      technologies for examining brain function in human infants. Yet the existing 
      software packages are not optimized for the unique requirements of analyzing 
      artifact-prone ERP data from infants. We developed a new graphical user interface 
      that enables an efficient implementation of a two-stage approach to the analysis 
      of infant ERPs. In the first stage, video records of infant behavior are 
      synchronized with ERPs at the level of individual trials to reject epochs with 
      noncompliant behavior and other artifacts. In the second stage, the interface 
      calls MATLAB and EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, Journal of Neuroscience Methods 
      134(1):9-21, 2004) functions for further preprocessing of the ERP signal itself 
      (i.e., filtering, artifact removal, interpolation, and rereferencing). Finally, 
      methods are included for data visualization and analysis by using bootstrapped 
      group averages. Analyses of simulated and real EEG data demonstrated that the 
      proposed approach can be effectively used to establish task compliance, remove 
      various types of artifacts, and perform representative visualizations and 
      statistical comparisons of ERPs. The interface is available for download from 
      http://www.uta.fi/med/icl/methods/eeg.html in a format that is widely applicable 
      to ERP studies with special populations and open for further editing by users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrocorticography (ECoG) permits recording electrical field 
      potentials with high spatiotemporal resolution over a large part of the cerebral 
      cortex. Application of chronically implanted ECoG arrays in animal models 
      provides an opportunity to investigate global spatiotemporal neural patterns and 
      functional connectivity systematically under various experimental conditions. 
      Although ECoG is conventionally used to cover the gyral cortical surface, recent 
      studies have shown the feasibility of intrasulcal ECoG recordings in macaque 
      monkeys. NEW METHOD: Here we developed a new ECoG array to record neural activity 
      simultaneously from much of the medial and lateral cortical surface of a single 
      hemisphere, together with the supratemporal plane (STP) of the lateral sulcus in 
      macaque monkeys. The ECoG array consisted of 256 electrodes for bipolar recording 
      at 128 sites. RESULTS: We successfully implanted the ECoG array in the left 
      hemisphere of three rhesus monkeys. The electrodes in the auditory and visual 
      cortex detected robust event related potentials to auditory and visual stimuli, 
      respectively. Bipolar recording from adjacent electrode pairs effectively 
      eliminated chewing artifacts evident in monopolar recording, demonstrating the 
      advantage of using the ECoG array under conditions that generate significant 
      movement artifacts. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with bipolar ECoG 
      arrays previously developed for macaque monkeys, this array significantly expands 
      the number of cortical target areas in gyral and intralsulcal cortex. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This new ECoG array provides an opportunity to investigate global 
      network interactions among gyral and intrasulcal cortical areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the EEG recordings are severely 
      contaminated by ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which are caused by cardiac 
      pulsations. To reconstruct and remove the BCG artifacts, one promising method is 
      to measure the artifacts in the absence of EEG signal by placing a group of 
      electrodes (BCG electrodes) on a conductive layer (reference layer) insulated 
      from the scalp. However, current BCG reference layer (BRL) methods either use a 
      customized EEG cap composed of electrode pairs, or need to construct the custom 
      reference layer through additional model-building experiments for each EEG-fMRI 
      experiment. These requirements have limited the versatility and efficiency of 
      BRL. The aim of this study is to propose a more practical and efficient BRL 
      method and compare its performance with the most popular BCG removal method, the 
      optimal basis sets (OBS) algorithm. NEW METHOD: By designing the reference layer 
      as a permanent and reusable cap, the new BRL method is able to be used with a 
      standard EEG cap, and no extra experiments and preparations are needed to use the 
      BRL in an EEG-fMRI experiment. RESULTS: The BRL method effectively removed the 
      BCG artifacts from both oscillatory and evoked potential scalp recordings and 
      recovered the EEG signal. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Compared to the OBS, 
      this new BRL method improved the contrast-to-noise ratios of the alpha-wave, 
      visual, and auditory evoked potential signals by 101%, 76%, and 75%, 
      respectively, employing 160 BCG electrodes. Using only 20 BCG electrodes, the BRL 
      improved the EEG signal by 74%/26%/41%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      method can substantially improve the EEG signal quality compared with traditional 
      methods.

TI  - Investigating the effect of modifying the EEG cap lead configuration on the 
      gradient artifact in simultaneous EEG-fMRI.

AB  - EEG data recorded during simultaneous fMRI are contaminated by large voltages 
      generated by time-varying magnetic field gradients. Correction of the resulting 
      gradient artifact (GA) generally involves low-pass filtering to attenuate the 
      high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, followed by subtraction of a GA 
      template produced by averaging over repeats of the artifact waveforms. This 
      average artifact subtraction (AAS) process relies on the EEG amplifier having a 
      large enough dynamic range to characterize the artifact voltages and on 
      invariance of the artifact waveform over repeated image acquisitions. Saturation 
      of the amplifiers and changes in subject position can leave unwanted residual GA 
      after AAS. Previous modeling work suggested that modifying the lead layout and 
      the exit position of the cable bundle on the EEG cap could reduce the GA 
      amplitude. Here, we used simulations and experiments to evaluate the effect of 
      modifying the lead paths on the magnitude of the GA and on the residual artifact 
      after AAS. The modeling work showed that for wire paths following great circles, 
      the smallest overall GA occurs when the leads converge at electrode Cz. The 
      performance of this new cap design was compared with a standard cap in 
      experiments on a spherical agar phantom and human subjects. Using gradient pulses 
      applied separately along the three Cartesian axes, we found that the GA due to 
      the foot-head gradient was most significantly reduced relative to a standard cap 
      for the phantom, whereas the anterior-posterior GA was most attenuated for human 
      subjects. In addition, there was an overall 37% reduction in the RMS GA amplitude 
      produced by a standard EPI sequence when comparing the two caps on the phantom. 
      In contrast, the subjects showed an 11% increase in the average RMS of the GA. 
      This work shows that the optimal design reduces the GA on a spherical phantom 
      however; these gains are not translated to human subjects, probably due to the 
      differences in geometry.

TI  - Removing ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact from full-scalp EEG acquired inside 
      the MR scanner with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).

AB  - Ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact remains a major challenge that renders 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals hard to interpret in simultaneous EEG and 
      functional MRI (fMRI) data acquisition. Here, we propose an integrated learning 
      and inference approach that takes advantage of a commercial high-density EEG cap, 
      to estimate the BCG contribution in noisy EEG recordings from inside the MR 
      scanner. To estimate reliably the full-scalp BCG artifacts, a near-optimal subset 
      (20 out of 256) of channels first was identified using a modified recording 
      setup. In subsequent recordings inside the MR scanner, BCG-only signal from this 
      subset of channels was used to generate continuous estimates of the full-scalp 
      BCG artifacts via inference, from which the intended EEG signal was recovered. 
      The reconstruction of the EEG was performed with both a direct subtraction and an 
      optimization scheme. We evaluated the performance on both synthetic and real 
      contaminated recordings, and compared it to the benchmark Optimal Basis Set (OBS) 
      method. In the challenging non-event-related-potential (non-ERP) EEG studies, our 
      reconstruction can yield more than fourteen-fold improvement in reducing the 
      normalized RMS error of EEG signals, compared to OBS.

AB  - The electrical activity of muscles can interfere with the electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) signal considering the anatomical locations of facial or masticatory 
      muscles surrounding the skull. In this study, we evaluated the possible 
      interference of the resting activity of the temporalis muscle on the EEG under 
      conventional EEG recording conditions. In 9 healthy adults EEG activity from 19 
      scalp locations and single motor unit (SMU) activity from anterior temporalis 
      muscle were recorded in three relaxed conditions; eyes open, eyes closed, jaw 
      dropped. The EEG signal was spike triggered averaged (STA) using the action 
      potentials of SMUs as triggers to evaluate their reflections at various EEG 
      recording sites. Resting temporalis SMU activity generated prominent reflections 
      with different amplitudes, reaching maxima in the proximity of the recorded SMU. 
      Interference was also notable at the scalp sites that are relatively far from the 
      recorded SMU and even at the contralateral locations. Considering the great 
      number of SMUs in the head and neck muscles, prominent contamination from the 
      activity of only a single MU should indicate the susceptibility of EEG to muscle 
      activity artifacts even under the rest conditions. This study emphasizes the need 
      for efficient artifact evaluation methods which can handle muscle interferences.

AB  - Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder ([Formula: see text]% 
      prevalence) affecting [Formula: see text] million people worldwide with up to 75% 
      from developing countries. The conventional electroencephalogram is plagued with 
      artifacts from movements, muscles, and other sources. Tripolar concentric ring 
      electrodes automatically attenuate muscle artifacts and provide improved signal 
      quality. We performed basic experiments in healthy humans to show that tripolar 
      concentric ring electrodes can indeed record the physiological alpha waves while 
      eyes are closed. We then conducted concurrent recordings with conventional disc 
      electrodes and tripolar concentric ring electrodes from patients with epilepsy. 
      We found that we could detect high frequency oscillations, a marker for early 
      seizure development and epileptogenic zone, on the scalp surface that appeared to 
      become more narrow-band just prior to seizures. High frequency oscillations 
      preceding seizures were present in an average of 35.5% of tripolar concentric 
      ring electrode data channels for all the patients with epilepsy whose seizures 
      were recorded and absent in the corresponding conventional disc electrode data. 
      An average of 78.2% of channels that contained high frequency oscillations were 
      within the seizure onset or irritative zones determined independently by three 
      epileptologists based on conventional disc electrode data and videos.

AB  - Despite considerable effort to remove it, the ballistocardiogram (BCG) remains a 
      major artifact in electroencephalographic data (EEG) acquired inside magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, particularly in continuous (as opposed to 
      event-related) recordings. In this study, we have developed a new Direct 
      Recording Prior Encoding (DRPE) method to extract and separate the BCG and EEG 
      components from contaminated signals, and have demonstrated its performance by 
      comparing it quantitatively to the popular Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method. Our 
      modified recording configuration allows us to obtain representative bases of the 
      BCG- and EEG-only signals. Further, we have developed an optimization-based 
      reconstruction approach to maximally incorporate prior knowledge of the BCG/EEG 
      subspaces, and of the signal characteristics within them. Both OBS and DRPE 
      methods were tested with experimental data, and compared quantitatively using 
      cross-validation. In the challenging continuous EEG studies, DRPE outperforms the 
      OBS method by nearly sevenfold in separating the continuous BCG and EEG signals.

AB  - Automatic interpretation of the EEG has so far been faced with significant 
      difficulties because of a large amount of spatial as well as temporal information 
      contained in the EEG, continuous fluctuation of the background activity depending 
      on changes in the subject's vigilance and attention level, the occurrence of 
      paroxysmal activities such as spikes and spike-and-slow-waves, contamination of 
      the EEG with a variety of artefacts and the use of different recording electrodes 
      and montages. Therefore, previous attempts of automatic EEG interpretation have 
      been focussed only on a specific EEG feature such as paroxysmal abnormalities, 
      delta waves, sleep stages and artefact detection. As a result of a long-standing 
      cooperation between clinical neurophysiologists and system engineers, we report 
      for the first time on a comprehensive, computer-assisted, automatic 
      interpretation of the adult waking EEG. This system analyses the background 
      activity, intermittent abnormalities, artefacts and the level of vigilance and 
      attention of the subject, and automatically presents its report in written form. 
      Besides, it also detects paroxysmal abnormalities and evaluates the effects of 
      intermittent photic stimulation and hyperventilation on the EEG. This system of 
      automatic EEG interpretation was formed by adopting the strategy that the 
      qualified EEGers employ for the systematic visual inspection. This system can be 
      used as a supplementary tool for the EEGer's visual inspection, and for educating 
      EEG trainees and EEG technicians.

AB  - Functional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a relatively new technique 
      complimentary to EEG for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). 
      NIRS-based systems for detecting various cognitive and affective states such as 
      mental and emotional stress have already been demonstrated in a range of adaptive 
      human-computer interaction (HCI) applications. However, before NIRS-BCIs can be 
      used reliably in realistic HCI settings, substantial challenges oncerning signal 
      processing and modeling must be addressed. Although many of those challenges have 
      been identified previously, the solutions to overcome them remain scant. In this 
      paper, we first review what can be currently done with NIRS, specifically, 
      NIRS-based approaches to measuring cognitive and affective user states as well as 
      demonstrations of passive NIRS-BCIs. We then discuss some of the primary 
      challenges these systems would face if deployed in more realistic settings, 
      including detection latencies and motion artifacts. Lastly, we investigate the 
      effects of some of these challenges on signal reliability via a quantitative 
      comparison of three NIRS models. The hope is that this paper will actively engage 
      researchers to acilitate the advancement of NIRS as a more robust and useful tool 
      to the BCI community.

AB  - The first reports of combined EEG and fMRI used for evaluation of epileptic 
      spikes date back to the mid-90s. At that time, the technique was called 
      EEG-triggered fMRI--the "triggered" corresponded to an epilepsy specialist 
      reviewing live EEG while the patient was located in the scanner; after the spike 
      was identified, a scan was initiated to collect the data. Since then major 
      progress has been made in combined EEG/fMRI data collection and analyses. These 
      advances allow studying the electrophysiology of genetic generalized epilepsies 
      (GGEs) in vivo in greater detail than ever. In addition to continuous data 
      collection, we now have better methods for removing physiologic and fMRI-related 
      artifacts, more advanced understanding of the hemodynamic response functions, and 
      better computational methods to address the questions regarding the origins of 
      the epileptiform discharge generators in patients with GGEs. These advances have 
      allowed us to examine numerous cohorts of children and adults with GGEs while not 
      only looking for spike and wave generators but also examining specific types of 
      GGEs (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or childhood absence epilepsy), 
      drug-naïve patients, effects of medication resistance, or effects of epileptiform 
      abnormalities and/or seizures on brain connectivity. While the discussion is 
      ongoing, the prevailing thought is that the GGEs as a group are a network 
      disorder with participation from multiple nodes including the thalami and cortex 
      with the clinical presentation depending on which node of the participating 
      network is affected by the disease process. This review discusses the 
      contributions of EEG/fMRI to our understanding of GGEs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of foramen ovale electrodes (FOEs) to 
      localize epileptogenic foci after inconclusive noninvasive investigations in 
      patients with suspected mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: We 
      identified patients with medically intractable epilepsy who had undergone FOE 
      investigation for initial invasive monitoring at our institution between 2005 and 
      2012. Indications for initiating FOE investigation were grouped into four 
      categories: (1) bilateral anterior temporal ictal activity on scalp 
      electroencephalography (EEG), (2) unclear laterality of scalp EEG onset due to 
      muscle artifact or significant delay following clinical manifestation, (3) 
      discordance between ictal and interictal discharges, and (4) investigation of a 
      specific anatomic abnormality or competing putative focus. The FOE investigation 
      was classified as informative if it provided sufficient evidence to make a 
      treatment decision. RESULTS: Forty-two consecutive patients underwent FOE 
      investigation, which was informative in 38 patients (90.5%). Of these 38 
      patients, 24 were determined to be appropriate candidates for resective surgery. 
      Five were localized sufficiently for surgery, but were considered high risk for 
      verbal memory deficit, and nine were deemed poor surgical candidates because of 
      bilateral ictal origins. The remaining 4 of 42 patients had inconclusive FOE 
      studies and were referred for further invasive investigation. Of the 18 patients 
      who underwent resective surgery, 13 (72%) were seizure-free (Engel class I) at 
      last follow-up (mean 22.5 months). SIGNIFICANCE: More than 90% of our 42 FOE 
      studies provided sufficient evidence to render treatment decisions. When 
      undertaken with an appropriate hypothesis, FOE investigations are a minimally 
      invasive and efficacious means for evaluating patients with suspected MTLE after 
      an inconclusive noninvasive investigation.

TI  - Third order spectral analysis robust to mixing artifacts for mapping 
      cross-frequency interactions in EEG/MEG.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.064 [doi]
AB  - We present a novel approach to the third order spectral analysis, commonly called 
      bispectral analysis, of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic 
      (MEG) data for studying cross-frequency functional brain connectivity. The main 
      obstacle in estimating functional connectivity from EEG and MEG measurements lies 
      in the signals being a largely unknown mixture of the activities of the 
      underlying brain sources. This often constitutes a severe confounder and heavily 
      affects the detection of brain source interactions. To overcome this problem, we 
      previously developed metrics based on the properties of the imaginary part of 
      coherency. Here, we generalize these properties from the linear to the nonlinear 
      case. Specifically, we propose a metric based on an antisymmetric combination of 
      cross-bispectra, which we demonstrate to be robust to mixing artifacts. Moreover, 
      our metric provides complex-valued quantities that give the opportunity to study 
      phase relationships between brain sources. The effectiveness of the method is 
      first demonstrated on simulated EEG data. The proposed approach shows a reduced 
      sensitivity to mixing artifacts when compared with a traditional bispectral 
      metric. It also exhibits a better performance in extracting phase relationships 
      between sources than the imaginary part of the cross-spectrum for delayed 
      interactions. The method is then applied to real EEG data recorded during resting 
      state. A cross-frequency interaction is observed between brain sources at 10Hz 
      and 20Hz, i.e., for alpha and beta rhythms. This interaction is then projected 
      from signal to source level by using a fit-based procedure. This approach 
      highlights a 10-20Hz dominant interaction localized in an 
      occipito-parieto-central network.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings after sleep deprivation increase the 
      diagnostic yield in patients suspected of epilepsy if the routine EEG remains 
      inconclusive. Sleep deprivation is associated with increased interictal EEG 
      abnormalities in patients with epilepsy, but the exact mechanism is unknown. In 
      this feasibility study, we used a network analytical approach to provide novel 
      insights into this clinical observation. The aim was to characterize the effect 
      of sleep deprivation on the interictal functional network organization using a 
      unique dataset of paired routine and sleep deprivation recordings in patients and 
      controls. We included 21 children referred to the first seizure clinic of our 
      center with suspected new onset focal epilepsy in whom a routine interictal and a 
      sleep deprivation EEG (SD-EEG) were performed. Seventeen children, in whom the 
      diagnosis of epilepsy was excluded, served as controls. For both time points 
      weighted functional networks were constructed based on interictal artifact free 
      time-series. Routine and sleep deprivation networks were characterized at 
      different frequency bands using minimum spanning tree (MST) measures (leaf number 
      and diameter) and classical measures of integration (path length) and segregation 
      (clustering coefficient). A significant interaction was found for leaf number and 
      diameter between patients and controls after sleep deprivation: patients showed a 
      shift toward a more path-like MST network whereas controls showed a shift toward 
      a more star-like MST network. This shift in network organization after sleep 
      deprivation in patients is in accordance with previous studies showing a more 
      regular network organization in the ictal state and might relate to the increased 
      epileptiform abnormalities found in patients after sleep deprivation. Larger 
      studies are needed to verify these results. Finally, MST measures were more 
      sensitive in detecting network changes as compared to the classical measures of 
      integration and segregation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)--the dependence of the amplitude of 
      one rhythm on the phase of another, lower-frequency rhythm - has recently been 
      used to illuminate cross-frequency coordination in neurophysiological activity. 
      An essential step in measuring PAC is decomposing data to obtain rhythmic 
      components of interest. Current methods of PAC assessment employ narrowband 
      Fourier-based filters, which assume that biological rhythms are stationary, 
      harmonic oscillations. However, biological signals frequently contain irregular 
      and nonstationary features, which may contaminate rhythms of interest and 
      complicate comodulogram interpretation, especially when frequency resolution is 
      limited by short data segments. NEW METHOD: To better account for 
      nonstationarities while maintaining sharp frequency resolution in PAC 
      measurement, even for short data segments, we introduce a new method of PAC 
      assessment which utilizes adaptive and more generally broadband decomposition 
      techniques - such as the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). To obtain high 
      frequency resolution PAC measurements, our method distributes the PAC associated 
      with pairs of broadband oscillations over frequency space according to the 
      time-local frequencies of these oscillations. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: 
      We compare our novel adaptive approach to a narrowband comodulogram approach on a 
      variety of simulated signals of short duration, studying systematically how 
      different types of nonstationarities affect these methods, as well as on EEG 
      data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show: (1) narrowband filtering can lead to poor 
      PAC frequency resolution, and inaccuracy and false negatives in PAC assessment; 
      (2) our adaptive approach attains better PAC frequency resolution and is more 
      resistant to nonstationarities and artifacts than traditional comodulograms.

LID - 213
AB  - ERPLAB toolbox is a freely available, open-source toolbox for processing and 
      analyzing event-related potential (ERP) data in the MATLAB environment. ERPLAB is 
      closely integrated with EEGLAB, a popular open-source toolbox that provides many 
      EEG preprocessing steps and an excellent user interface design. ERPLAB adds to 
      EEGLAB's EEG processing functions, providing additional tools for filtering, 
      artifact detection, re-referencing, and sorting of events, among others. ERPLAB 
      also provides robust tools for averaging EEG segments together to create averaged 
      ERPs, for creating difference waves and other recombinations of ERP waveforms 
      through algebraic expressions, for filtering and re-referencing the averaged 
      ERPs, for plotting ERP waveforms and scalp maps, and for quantifying several 
      types of amplitudes and latencies. ERPLAB's tools can be accessed either from an 
      easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from MATLAB scripts, and a command 
      history function makes it easy for users with no programming experience to write 
      scripts. Consequently, ERPLAB provides both ease of use and virtually unlimited 
      power and flexibility, making it appropriate for the analysis of both simple and 
      complex ERP experiments. Several forms of documentation are available, including 
      a detailed user's guide, a step-by-step tutorial, a scripting guide, and a set of 
      video-based demonstrations.

TI  - Human intracranial high frequency oscillations (HFOs) detected by automatic 
      time-frequency analysis.
PG  - e94381

AB  - OBJECTIVES: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a new 
      biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. The exact characteristics of clinically 
      relevant HFOs and their detection are still to be defined. METHODS: We propose a 
      new method for HFO detection, which we have applied to six patient iEEGs. In a 
      first stage, events of interest (EoIs) in the iEEG were defined by thresholds of 
      energy and duration. To recognize HFOs among the EoIs, in a second stage the iEEG 
      was Stockwell-transformed into the time-frequency domain, and the instantaneous 
      power spectrum was parameterized. The parameters were optimized for HFO detection 
      in patient 1 and tested in patients 2-5. Channels were ranked by HFO rate and 
      those with rate above half maximum constituted the HFO area. The seizure onset 
      zone (SOZ) served as gold standard. RESULTS: The detector distinguished HFOs from 
      artifacts and other EEG activity such as interictal epileptiform spikes. 
      Computation took few minutes. We found HFOs with relevant power at frequencies 
      also below the 80-500 Hz band, which is conventionally associated with HFOs. The 
      HFO area overlapped with the SOZ with good specificity > 90% for five patients 
      and one patient was re-operated. The performance of the detector was compared to 
      two well-known detectors. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to methods detecting energy 
      changes in filtered signals, our second stage - analysis in the time-frequency 
      domain - discards spurious detections caused by artifacts or sharp epileptic 
      activity and improves the detection of HFOs. The fast computation and reasonable 
      accuracy hold promise for the diagnostic value of the detector.

AB  - Although efforts to characterize human movement through electroencephalography 
      (EEG) have revealed neural activities unique to limb control that can be used to 
      infer movement kinematics, it is still unknown the extent to which EEG can be 
      used to discern the expressive qualities that influence such movements. In this 
      study we used EEG and inertial sensors to record brain activity and movement of 
      five skilled and certified Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) dancers. Each dancer 
      performed whole body movements of three Action types: movements devoid of 
      expressive qualities ("Neutral"), non-expressive movements while thinking about 
      specific expressive qualities ("Think"), and enacted expressive movements ("Do"). 
      The expressive movement qualities that were used in the "Think" and "Do" actions 
      consisted of a sequence of eight Laban Effort qualities as defined by LMA-a 
      notation system and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and 
      documenting all varieties of human movement. We used delta band (0.2-4 Hz) EEG as 
      input to a machine learning algorithm that computed locality-preserving Fisher's 
      discriminant analysis (LFDA) for dimensionality reduction followed by Gaussian 
      mixture models (GMMs) to decode the type of Action. We also trained our LFDA-GMM 
      models to classify all the possible combinations of Action Type and Laban Effort 
      quality (giving a total of 17 classes). Classification accuracy rates were 59.4 ± 
      0.6% for Action Type and 88.2 ± 0.7% for Laban Effort quality Type. Ancillary 
      analyses of the potential relations between the EEG and movement kinematics of 
      the dancer's body, indicated that motion-related artifacts did not significantly 
      influence our classification results. In summary, this research demonstrates that 
      EEG has valuable information about the expressive qualities of movement. These 
      results may have applications for advancing the understanding of the neural basis 
      of expressive movements and for the development of neuroprosthetics to restore 
      movements.

TI  - Methods for implantation of micro-wire bundles and optimization of 
      single/multi-unit recordings from human mesial temporal lobe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors report methods developed for the implantation of 
      micro-wire bundles into mesial temporal lobe structures and subsequent single 
      neuron recording in epileptic patients undergoing in-patient diagnostic 
      monitoring. This is done with the intention of lowering the perceived barriers to 
      routine single neuron recording from deep brain structures in the clinical 
      setting. APPROACH: Over a 15 month period, 11 patients were implanted with 
      platinum micro-wire bundles into mesial temporal structures. Protocols were 
      developed for (A) monitoring electrode integrity through impedance testing, (B) 
      ensuring continuous 24-7 recording, (C) localizing micro-wire position and 
      'splay' pattern and (D) monitoring grounding and referencing to maintain the 
      quality of recordings. MAIN RESULTS: Five common modes of failure were 
      identified: (1) broken micro-wires from acute tensile force, (2) broken 
      micro-wires from cyclic fatigue at stress points, (3) poor in vivo 
      micro-electrode separation, (4) motion artifact and (5) deteriorating ground 
      connection and subsequent drop in common mode noise rejection. Single neurons 
      have been observed up to 14 days post-implantation and on 40% of micro-wires. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Long-term success requires detailed review of each implant by both 
      the clinical and research teams to identify failure modes, and appropriate 
      refinement of techniques while moving forward. This approach leads to reliable 
      unit recordings without prolonging operative times, which will help increase the 
      availability and clinical viability of human single neuron data.

TI  - Sleep spindles and rapid eye movement sleep as predictors of next morning 
      cognitive performance in healthy middle-aged and older participants.
PG  - 159-67
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12108 [doi]
AB  - Spindles and slow waves are hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Both these 
      oscillations are markers of neuronal plasticity, and play a role in memory and 
      cognition. Normal ageing is associated with spindle and slow wave decline and 
      cognitive changes. The present study aimed to assess whether spindle and slow 
      wave characteristics during a baseline night predict cognitive performance in 
      healthy older adults the next morning. Specifically, we examined performance on 
      tasks measuring selective and sustained visual attention, declarative verbal 
      memory, working memory and verbal fluency. Fifty-eight healthy middle-aged and 
      older adults (aged 50-91 years) without sleep disorders underwent baseline 
      polysomnographic sleep recording followed by neuropsychological assessment the 
      next morning. Spindles and slow waves were detected automatically on 
      artefact-free non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram. All-night stage 
      N2 spindle density (no./min) and mean frequency (Hz) and all-night non-rapid eye 
      movement sleep slow wave density (no./min) and mean slope (μV/s) were analysed. 
      Pearson's correlations were performed between spindles, slow waves, 
      polysomnography and cognitive performance. Higher spindle density predicted 
      better performance on verbal learning, visual attention and verbal fluency, 
      whereas spindle frequency and slow wave density or slope predicted fewer 
      cognitive performance variables. In addition, rapid eye movement sleep duration 
      was associated with better verbal learning potential. These results suggest that 
      spindle density is a marker of cognitive functioning in older adults and may 
      reflect neuroanatomic integrity. Rapid eye movement sleep may be a marker of 
      age-related changes in acetylcholine transmission, which plays a role in new 
      information encoding.

TI  - The effects of automated artifact removal algorithms on 
      electroencephalography-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

AB  - Over the last decade, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a reliable tool 
      for the diagnosis of cortical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). EEG 
      signals, however, are susceptible to several artifacts, such as ocular, muscular, 
      movement, and environmental. To overcome this limitation, existing diagnostic 
      systems commonly depend on experienced clinicians to manually select 
      artifact-free epochs from the collected multi-channel EEG data. Manual selection, 
      however, is a tedious and time-consuming process, rendering the diagnostic system 
      "semi-automated." Notwithstanding, a number of EEG artifact removal algorithms 
      have been proposed in the literature. The (dis)advantages of using such 
      algorithms in automated AD diagnostic systems, however, have not been documented; 
      this paper aims to fill this gap. Here, we investigate the effects of three 
      state-of-the-art automated artifact removal (AAR) algorithms (both alone and in 
      combination with each other) on AD diagnostic systems based on four different 
      classes of EEG features, namely, spectral, amplitude modulation rate of change, 
      coherence, and phase. The three AAR algorithms tested are statistical artifact 
      rejection (SAR), blind source separation based on second order blind 
      identification and canonical correlation analysis (BSS-SOBI-CCA), and wavelet 
      enhanced independent component analysis (wICA). Experimental results based on 
      20-channel resting-awake EEG data collected from 59 participants (20 patients 
      with mild AD, 15 with moderate-to-severe AD, and 24 age-matched healthy controls) 
      showed the wICA algorithm alone outperforming other enhancement algorithm 
      combinations across three tasks: diagnosis (control vs. mild vs. moderate), early 
      detection (control vs. mild), and disease progression (mild vs. moderate), thus 
      opening the doors for fully-automated systems that can assist clinicians with 
      early detection of AD, as well as disease severity progression assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of ultrasound in brain tumor surgery is common. The difference in 
      attenuation between brain and isotonic saline may cause artifacts that degrade 
      the ultrasound images, potentially affecting resection grades and safety. Our 
      research group has developed an acoustic coupling fluid that attenuates 
      ultrasound energy like the normal brain. We aimed to test in animals if the newly 
      developed acoustic coupling fluid may have harmful effects. METHODS: Eight rats 
      were included for intraparenchymal injection into the brain, and if no adverse 
      reactions were detected, 6 pigs were to be included with injection of the 
      coupling fluid into the subarachnoid space. Animal behavior, EEG registrations, 
      histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used in assessment. RESULTS: In 
      total, 14 animals were included, 8 rats and 6 pigs. We did not detect any 
      clinical adverse effects, seizure activity on EEG or histopathological signs of 
      tissue damage. CONCLUSION: The novel acoustic coupling fluid intended for brain 
      tumor surgery appears safe in rats and pigs under the tested circumstances.

AB  - EEG involves the recording, analysis, and interpretation of voltages recorded on 
      the human scalp which originate from brain gray matter. EEG is one of the most 
      popular methods of studying and understanding the processes that underlie 
      behavior. This is so, because EEG is relatively cheap, easy to wear, light weight 
      and has high temporal resolution. In terms of behavior, this encompasses actions, 
      such as movements that are performed in response to the environment. However, 
      there are methodological difficulties which can occur when recording EEG during 
      movement such as movement artifacts. Thus, most studies about the human brain 
      have examined activations during static conditions. This article attempts to 
      compile and describe relevant methodological solutions that emerged in order to 
      measure body and brain dynamics during motion. These descriptions cover 
      suggestions on how to avoid and reduce motion artifacts, hardware, software and 
      techniques for synchronously recording EEG, EMG, kinematics, kinetics, and eye 
      movements during motion. Additionally, we present various recording systems, EEG 
      electrodes, caps and methods for determinating real/custom electrode positions. 
      In the end we will conclude that it is possible to record and analyze 
      synchronized brain and body dynamics related to movement or exercise tasks.

AB  - Magnetoencephalography (MEG) non-invasively measures the magnetic field generated 
      due to the excitatory postsynaptic electrical activity of the apical dendritic 
      pyramidal cells. Such a tiny magnetic field is measured with the help of the 
      biomagnetometer sensors coupled with the Super Conducting Quantum Interference 
      Device (SQUID) inside the magnetically shielded room (MSR). The subjects are 
      usually screened for the presence of ferromagnetic materials, and then the head 
      position indicator coils, electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes (if measured 
      simultaneously), and fiducials are digitized using a 3D digitizer, which aids in 
      movement correction and also in transferring the MEG data from the head 
      coordinates to the device and voxel coordinates, thereby enabling more accurate 
      co-registration and localization. MEG data pre-processing involves filtering the 
      data for environmental and subject interferences, artefact identification, and 
      rejection. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is processed for correction and 
      identifying fiducials. After choosing and computing for the appropriate head 
      models (spherical or realistic; boundary/finite element model), the 
      interictal/ictal epileptiform discharges are selected and modeled by an 
      appropriate source modeling technique (clinically and commonly used - single 
      equivalent current dipole - ECD model). The equivalent current dipole (ECD) 
      source localization of the modeled interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) is 
      considered physiologically valid or acceptable based on waveform morphology, 
      isofield pattern, and dipole parameters (localization, dipole moment, confidence 
      volume, goodness of fit). Thus, MEG source localization can aid clinicians in 
      sublobar localization, lateralization, and grid placement, by evoking the 
      irritative/seizure onset zone. It also accurately localizes the eloquent 
      cortex-like visual, language areas. MEG also aids in diagnosing and delineating 
      multiple novel findings in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism, Traumatic brain injury, autistic disorders, 
      and so oon.

AB  - Novel methods for neuronal entrainment [1-4] provide the unique opportunity to 
      modulate perceptually relevant brain oscillations [5, 6] in a frequency-specific 
      manner and to study their functional impact on distinct cognitive functions. 
      Recently, evidence has emerged that tACS (transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation) can modulate cortical oscillations [7-9]. However, the study of 
      electrophysiological effects has been hampered so far by the absence of 
      concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Here, we applied 10 Hz tACS to 
      the parieto-occipital cortex and utilized simultaneous EEG recordings to study 
      neuronal entrainment during stimulation. We pioneer a novel approach for 
      simultaneous tACS-EEG recordings and successfully separate stimulation artifacts 
      from ongoing and event-related cortical activity. Our results reveal that 10 Hz 
      tACS increases parieto-occipital alpha activity and synchronizes cortical 
      oscillators with similar intrinsic frequencies to the entrainment frequency. 
      Additionally, we demonstrate that tACS modulates target detection performance in 
      a phase-dependent fashion highlighting the causal role of alpha oscillations for 
      visual perception.

TI  - Does the supplementary motor area keep patients with Ondine's curse syndrome 
      breathing while awake?

LID - e84534
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare 
      neuro-respiratory disorder associated with mutations of the PHOX2B gene. Patients 
      with this disease experience severe hypoventilation during sleep and are 
      consequently ventilator-dependent. However, they breathe almost normally while 
      awake, indicating the existence of cortical mechanisms compensating for the 
      deficient brainstem generation of automatic breathing. Current evidence indicates 
      that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in modulating 
      ventilation in awake normal humans. We hypothesized that the wake-related 
      maintenance of spontaneous breathing in patients with CCHS could involve 
      supplementary motor area. METHODS: We studied 7 CCHS patients (5 women; age: 
      20-30; BMI: 22.1 ± 4 kg.m(-2)) during resting breathing and during exposure to 
      carbon dioxide and inspiratory mechanical constraints. They were compared with 8 
      healthy individuals. Segments of electroencephalographic tracings were selected 
      according to ventilatory flow signal, from 2.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds after the 
      onset of inspiration. After artefact rejection, 80 or more such segments were 
      ensemble averaged. A slow upward shift of the EEG signal starting between 2 and 
      0.5 s before inspiration (pre-inspiratory potential) was considered suggestive of 
      supplementary motor area activation. RESULTS: In the control group, 
      pre-inspiratory potentials were generally absent during resting breathing and 
      carbon dioxide stimulation, and consistently identified in the presence of 
      inspiratory constraints (expected). In CCHS patients, pre-inspiratory potentials 
      were systematically identified in all study conditions, including resting 
      breathing. They were therefore significantly more frequent than in controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a neurophysiological substrate to the 
      wakefulness drive to breathe that is characteristic of CCHS and suggests that the 
      supplementary motor area contributes to this phenomenon. Whether or not this 
      "cortical breathing" can be taken advantage of therapeutically, or has clinical 
      consequences (like competition with attentional resources) remains to be 
      determined.

AB  - As the applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) continue to broaden and 
      long-term clinical monitoring becomes more common, minimizing signal artifacts 
      due to patient movement becomes more pressing. This is particularly true in 
      applications where clinically and physiologically interesting events are 
      intrinsically linked to patient movement, as is the case in the study of 
      epileptic seizures. In this study, we apply an approach common in the application 
      of EEG electrodes to the application of specialized NIRS optical fibers. The 
      method provides improved optode-scalp coupling through the use of miniaturized 
      optical fiber tips fixed to the scalp using collodion, a clinical adhesive. We 
      investigate and quantify the performance of this new method in minimizing motion 
      artifacts in healthy subjects, and apply the technique to allow continuous NIRS 
      monitoring throughout epileptic seizures in two epileptic in-patients. Using 
      collodion-fixed fibers reduces the percent signal change of motion artifacts by 
      90% and increases the SNR by 6 and 3 fold at 690 and 830 nm wavelengths 
      respectively when compared to a standard Velcro-based array of optical fibers. 
      The SNR has also increased by 2 fold during rest conditions without motion with 
      the new probe design because of better light coupling between the fiber and 
      scalp. The change in both HbO and HbR during motion artifacts is found to be 
      statistically lower for the collodion-fixed fiber probe. The collodion-fixed 
      optical fiber approach has also allowed us to obtain good quality NIRS recording 
      of three epileptic seizures in two patients despite excessive motion in each 
      case.

PG  - 259121

LID - 259121
AB  - An effective approach is proposed in this paper to remove ocular artifacts from 
      the raw EEG recording. The proposed approach first conducts the blind source 
      separation on the raw EEG recording by the stationary subspace analysis (SSA) 
      algorithm. Unlike the classic blind source separation algorithms, SSA is 
      explicitly tailored to the understanding of distribution changes, where both the 
      mean and the covariance matrix are taken into account. In addition, neither 
      independency nor uncorrelation is required among the sources by SSA. Thereby, it 
      can concentrate artifacts in fewer components than the representative blind 
      source separation methods. Next, the components that are determined to be related 
      to the ocular artifacts are projected back to be subtracted from EEG signals, 
      producing the clean EEG data eventually. The experimental results on both the 
      artificially contaminated EEG data and real EEG data have demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular for the cases where limited 
      number of electrodes are used for the recording, as well as when the artifact 
      contaminated signal is highly nonstationary and the underlying sources cannot be 
      assumed to be independent or uncorrelated.

AB  - In the present work, we demonstrate a method for concurrent collection of 
      EEG/fMRI data. In our setup, EEG data are collected using a high-density 
      256-channel sensor net. The EEG amplifier itself is contained in a field 
      isolation containment system (FICS), and MRI clock signals are synchronized with 
      EEG data collection for subsequent MR artifact characterization and removal. We 
      demonstrate this method first for resting state data collection. Thereafter, we 
      demonstrate a protocol for EEG/fMRI data recording, while subjects listen to a 
      tape asking them to visualize that their left hand is immersed in a cold-water 
      bath and referred to, here, as the cold glove paradigm. Thermal differentials 
      between each hand are measured throughout EEG/fMRI data collection using an MR 
      compatible temperature sensor that we developed for this purpose. We collect cold 
      glove EEG/fMRI data along with simultaneous differential hand temperature 
      measurements both before and after hypnotic induction. Between pre and post 
      sessions, single modality EEG data are collected during the hypnotic induction 
      and depth assessment process. Our representative results demonstrate that 
      significant changes in the EEG power spectrum can be measured during hypnotic 
      induction, and that hand temperature changes during the cold glove paradigm can 
      be detected rapidly using our MR compatible differential thermometry device.

AB  - The mirror neuron system (MNS) in humans is thought to enable an individual's 
      understanding of the meaning of actions performed by others and the potential 
      imitation and learning of those actions. In humans, electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      changes in sensorimotor a-band at central electrodes, which desynchronizes both 
      during execution and observation of goal-directed actions (i.e., μ suppression), 
      have been considered an analog to MNS function. However, methodological and 
      developmental issues, as well as the nature of generalized μ suppression to 
      imagined, observed, and performed actions, have yet to provide a mechanistic 
      relationship between EEG μ-rhythm and MNS function, and the extent to which EEG 
      can be used to infer intent during MNS tasks remains unknown. In this study we 
      present a novel methodology using active EEG and inertial sensors to record brain 
      activity and behavioral actions from freely-behaving infants during exploration, 
      imitation, attentive rest, pointing, reaching and grasping, and interaction with 
      an actor. We used 5-band (1-4Hz) EEG as input to a dimensionality reduction 
      algorithm (locality-preserving Fisher's discriminant analysis, LFDA) followed by 
      a neural classifier (Gaussian mixture models, GMMs) to decode the each MNS task 
      performed by freely-behaving 6-24 month old infants during interaction with an 
      adult actor. Here, we present results from a 20-month male infant to illustrate 
      our approach and show the feasibility of EEG-based classification of freely 
      occurring MNS behaviors displayed by an infant. These results, which provide an 
      alternative to the μ-rhythm theory of MNS function, indicate the informative 
      nature of EEG in relation to intentionality (goal) for MNS tasks which may 
      support action-understanding and thus bear implications for advancing the 
      understanding of MNS function.

TI  - Dual adaptive filtering by optimal projection applied to filter muscle artifacts

AB  - Muscle artifacts constitute one of the major problems in electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) examinations, particularly for the diagnosis of epilepsy, where 
      pathological rhythms occur within the same frequency bands as those of artifacts. 
      This paper proposes to use the method dual adaptive filtering by optimal 
      projection (DAFOP) to automatically remove artifacts while preserving true 
      cerebral signals. DAFOP is a two-step method. The first step consists in applying 
      the common spatial pattern (CSP) method to two frequency windows to identify the 
      slowest components which will be considered as cerebral sources. The two 
      frequency windows are defined by optimizing convolutional filters. The second 
      step consists in using a regression method to reconstruct the signal 
      independently within various frequency windows. This method was evaluated by two 
      neurologists on a selection of 114 pages with muscle artifacts, from 20 clinical 
      recordings of awake and sleeping adults, subject to pathological signals and 
      epileptic seizures. A blind comparison was then conducted with the canonical 
      correlation analysis (CCA) method and conventional low-pass filtering at 30 Hz. 
      The filtering rate was 84.3% for muscle artifacts with a 6.4% reduction of 
      cerebral signals even for the fastest waves. DAFOP was found to be significantly 
      more efficient than CCA and 30 Hz filters. The DAFOP method is fast and automatic 
      and can be easily used in clinical EEG recordings.

AB  - Effective seizure detection from long-term EEG is highly important for seizure 
      diagnosis. Existing methods usually design the feature and classifier 
      individually, while little work has been done for the simultaneous optimization 
      of the two parts. This work proposes a deep network to jointly learn a feature 
      and a classifier so that they could help each other to make the whole system 
      optimal. To deal with the challenge of the impulsive noises and outliers caused 
      by EMG artifacts in EEG signals, we formulate a robust stacked autoencoder 
      (R-SAE) as a part of the network to learn an effective feature. In R-SAE, the 
      maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is proposed to reduce the effect of 
      noise/outliers. Unlike the mean square error (MSE), the output of the new kernel 
      MCC increases more slowly than that of MSE when the input goes away from the 
      center. Thus, the effect of those noises/outliers positioned far away from the 
      center can be suppressed. The proposed method is evaluated on six patients of 
      33.6 hours of scalp EEG data. Our method achieves a sensitivity of 100% and a 
      specificity of 99%, which is promising for clinical applications.

AB  - The early detection and classification of dementia are important clinical support 
      tasks for medical practitioners in customizing patient treatment programs to 
      better manage the development and progression of these diseases. Efforts are 
      being made to diagnose these neurodegenerative disorders in the early stages. 
      Indeed, early diagnosis helps patients to obtain the maximum treatment benefit 
      before significant mental decline occurs. The use of electroencephalogram as a 
      tool for the detection of changes in brain activities and clinical diagnosis is 
      becoming increasingly popular for its capabilities in quantifying changes in 
      brain degeneration in dementia. This paper reviews the role of 
      electroencephalogram as a biomarker based on signal processing to detect dementia 
      in early stages and classify its severity. The review starts with a discussion of 
      dementia types and cognitive spectrum followed by the presentation of the 
      effective preprocessing denoising to eliminate possible artifacts. It continues 
      with a description of feature extraction by using linear and nonlinear 
      techniques, and it ends with a brief explanation of vast variety of separation 
      techniques to classify EEG signals. This paper also provides an idea from the 
      most popular studies that may help in diagnosing dementia in early stages and 
      classifying through electroencephalogram signal processing and analysis.

TI  - Robust features for the automatic identification of autism spectrum disorder in 
      children.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-6-12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly reported that children with autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD) exhibit hyper-reactivity or hypo-reactivity to sensory stimuli. 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to study neural sensory reactivity, 
      suggesting that statistical analysis of EEG recordings is a potential means of 
      automatic classification of the disorder. EEG recordings taken from children, 
      however, are frequently contaminated with large amounts of noise, making analysis 
      difficult. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic extraction of 
      noise-robust EEG features, which serve to quantify neural sensory reactivity. We 
      show the efficacy of a system for the classification of ASD using these features. 
      METHODS: An oddball paradigm was used to elicit event-related potentials from a 
      group of 19 ASD children and 30 typically developing children. EEG recordings 
      were taken and robust features were extracted. A support vector machine, logistic 
      regression, and a naive Bayes classifier were used to classify the children as 
      having ASD or being typically developing. RESULTS: A classification accuracy of 
      79% was achieved, making our method competitive with other automatic diagnosis 
      methods based on EEG. Additionally, we found that classification performance is 
      reduced if eye blink artifacts are removed during preprocessing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study shows that robust EEG features that quantify neural sensory reactivity 
      are useful for the classification of ASD. We showed that noise-robust features 
      are crucial for our analysis, and observe that traditional preprocessing methods 
      may lead to poor classification performance in the face of a large amount of 
      noise. Further exploration of alternative preprocessing methods is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the technical feasibility and the potential interest of 
      using a digital optical camera inside the MR magnet bore for monitoring the 
      breathing cycle and subsequently gating the PRFS MR thermometry, MR-ARFI 
      measurement, and MRgHIFU sonication in the upper abdomen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A digital camera was reengineered to remove its magnetic parts and was further 
      equipped with a 7 m long USB cable. The system was electromagnetically shielded 
      and operated inside the bore of a closed 3T clinical scanner. Suitable triggers 
      were generated based on real-time motion analysis of the images produced by the 
      camera (resolution 640 × 480 pixels, 30 fps). Respiratory-gated MR-ARFI prepared 
      MRgHIFU ablation was performed in the kidney and liver of two sheep in vivo, 
      under general anaesthesia and ventilator-driven forced breathing. RESULTS: The 
      optical device demonstrated very good MR compatibility. The current setup 
      permitted the acquisition of motion artefact-free and high resolution MR 2D ARFI 
      and multiplanar interleaved PRFS thermometry (average SNR 30 in liver and 56 in 
      kidney). Microscopic histology indicated precise focal lesions with sharply 
      delineated margins following the respiratory-gated HIFU sonications. CONCLUSION: 
      The proof-of-concept for respiratory motion management in MRgHIFU using an 
      in-bore digital camera has been validated in vivo.

      artefacts during simultaneous fMRI.

AB  - Large artefacts compromise EEG data quality during simultaneous fMRI. These 
      artefact voltages pose heavy demands on the bandwidth and dynamic range of EEG 
      amplifiers and mean that even small fractional variations in the artefact 
      voltages give rise to significant residual artefacts after average artefact 
      subtraction. Any intrinsic reduction in the magnitude of the artefacts would be 
      highly advantageous, allowing data with a higher bandwidth to be acquired without 
      amplifier saturation, as well as reducing the residual artefacts that can easily 
      swamp signals from brain activity measured using current methods. Since these 
      problems currently limit the utility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, new approaches for 
      reducing the magnitude and variability of the artefacts are required. One such 
      approach is the use of an EEG cap that incorporates electrodes embedded in a 
      reference layer that has similar conductivity to tissue and is electrically 
      isolated from the scalp. With this arrangement, the artefact voltages produced on 
      the reference layer leads by time-varying field gradients, cardiac pulsation and 
      subject movement are similar to those induced in the scalp leads, but neuronal 
      signals are not detected in the reference layer. Taking the difference of the 
      voltages in the reference and scalp channels will therefore reduce the artefacts, 
      without affecting sensitivity to neuronal signals. Here, we test this approach by 
      using a simple experimental realisation of the reference layer to investigate the 
      artefacts induced on the leads attached to the reference layer and scalp and to 
      evaluate the degree of artefact attenuation that can be achieved via reference 
      layer artefact subtraction (RLAS). Through a series of experiments on phantoms 
      and human subjects, we show that RLAS significantly reduces the gradient (GA), 
      pulse (PA) and motion (MA) artefacts, while allowing accurate recording of 
      neuronal signals. The results indicate that RLAS generally outperforms AAS when 
      motion is present in the removal of the GA and PA, while the combination of AAS 
      and RLAS always produces higher artefact attenuation than AAS. Additionally, we 
      demonstrate that RLAS greatly attenuates the unpredictable and highly variable 
      MAs that are very hard to remove using post-processing methods.

AB  - In this article a quantitative analysis was devised assessing driver's cognition 
      responses by exploring the neurobiological information underlying 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals in a left and right turning 
      experiment on simulator environment. Driving brain signals have been collected by 
      a 19-channel electroencephalogram recording system. The driving pathway has been 
      selected with no obstacles, a set of indicators are used to inform the subjects 
      when they had to turn left or right by means of keyboard left and right arrows. 
      Subsequently in order to remove artifacts, preprocessing is performed on data to 
      achieve high accuracy. Features of signals are extracted by using Fast Fourier 
      Transform (FFT). Absolute power of FFT is used as a basic feature. Scalar Feature 
      selection method is applied to reduce feature dimension. Thereafter 
      dimension-reduced features are fed to Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) recognizing 
      different brain potentials stimulated by turning to left and right. The 
      performances of HNN are evaluated by considering five conditions; before feature 
      extraction, after feature extraction, before reduction of features, after 
      analyzing reduced features and finally subject-wise Hopfield performances 
      respectively. An increase occurred in each level and continued until it has 
      reached its highest 97.6% of accuracy on last condition.

TI  - Reconstructing coherent networks from electroencephalography and 
      magnetoencephalography with reduced contamination from volume conduction or 
      magnetic field spread.
PG  - e81553
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0081553 [doi]
LID - e81553
AB  - Volume conduction (VC) and magnetic field spread (MFS) induce spurious 
      correlations between EEG/MEG sensors, such that the estimation of functional 
      networks from scalp recordings is inaccurate. Imaginary coherency [1] reduces 
      VC/MFS artefacts between sensors by assuming that instantaneous interactions are 
      caused predominantly by VC/MFS and do not contribute to the imaginary part of the 
      cross-spectral densities (CSDs). We propose an adaptation of the dynamic imaging 
      of coherent sources (DICS) [2] - a method for reconstructing the CSDs between 
      sources, and subsequently inferring functional connectivity based on coherences 
      between those sources. Firstly, we reformulate the principle of imaginary 
      coherency by performing an eigenvector decomposition of the imaginary part of the 
      CSD to estimate the power that only contributes to the non-zero phase-lagged 
      (NZPL) interactions. Secondly, we construct an NZPL-optimised spatial filter with 
      two a priori assumptions: (1) that only NZPL interactions exist at the source 
      level and (2) the NZPL CSD at the sensor level is a good approximation of the 
      projected source NZPL CSDs. We compare the performance of the NZPL method to the 
      standard method by reconstructing a coherent network from simulated EEG/MEG 
      recordings. We demonstrate that, as long as there are phase differences between 
      the sources, the NZPL method reliably detects the underlying networks from EEG 
      and MEG. We show that the method is also robust to very small phase lags, noise 
      from phase jitter, and is less sensitive to regularisation parameters. The method 
      is applied to a human dataset to infer parts of a coherent network underpinning 
      face recognition.

      hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.
PG  - 194
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-13-194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is a useful tool 
      to determine the severity of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our 
      aim was to assess the prevalence and study the origin of false normal aEEG 
      recordings based on 85 aEEG recordings registered before six hours of age. 
      METHODS: Raw EEG recordings were reevaluated retrospectively with Fourier 
      analysis to identify and describe the frequency patterns of the raw EEG signal, 
      in cases with inconsistent aEEG recordings and clinical symptoms. Power spectral 
      density curves, power (P) and median frequency (MF) were determined using the raw 
      EEG. In 7 patients non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NDMR) exposure was found. 
      The EEG sections were analyzed and compared before and after NDMR administration. 
      RESULTS: The reevaluation found that the aEEG was truly normal in 4 neonates. In 
      3 neonates, high voltage electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts were found with 
      flat trace on raw EEG. High frequency component (HFC) was found as a cause of 
      normal appearing aEEG in 10 neonates. HFC disappeared while P and MF decreased 
      significantly upon NDMR administration in each observed case. CONCLUSION: 
      Occurrence of false normal aEEG background pattern is relatively high in neonates 
      with HIE and hypothermia. High frequency EEG artifacts suggestive of shivering 
      were found to be the most common cause of false normal aEEG in hypothermic 
      neonates while high voltage ECG artifacts are less common.

TI  - FACET - a "Flexible Artifact Correction and Evaluation Toolbox" for concurrently 
      recorded EEG/fMRI data.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/1471-2202-14-138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In concurrent EEG/fMRI recordings, EEG data are impaired by the fMRI 
      gradient artifacts which exceed the EEG signal by several orders of magnitude. 
      While several algorithms exist to correct the EEG data, these algorithms lack the 
      flexibility to either leave out or add new steps. The here presented open-source 
      MATLAB toolbox FACET is a modular toolbox for the fast and flexible correction 
      and evaluation of imaging artifacts from concurrently recorded EEG datasets. It 
      consists of an Analysis, a Correction and an Evaluation framework allowing the 
      user to choose from different artifact correction methods with various pre- and 
      post-processing steps to form flexible combinations. The quality of the chosen 
      correction approach can then be evaluated and compared to different settings. 
      RESULTS: FACET was evaluated on a dataset provided with the FMRIB plugin for 
      EEGLAB using two different correction approaches: Averaged Artifact Subtraction 
      (AAS, Allen et al., NeuroImage 12(2):230-239, 2000) and the FMRI Artifact Slice 
      Template Removal (FASTR, Niazy et al., NeuroImage 28(3):720-737, 2005). 
      Evaluation of the obtained results were compared to the FASTR algorithm 
      implemented in the EEGLAB plugin FMRIB. No differences were found between the 
      FACET implementation of FASTR and the original algorithm across all gradient 
      artifact relevant performance indices. CONCLUSION: The FACET toolbox not only 
      provides facilities for all three modalities: data analysis, artifact correction 
      as well as evaluation and documentation of the results but it also offers an 
      easily extendable framework for development and evaluation of new approaches.

TI  - EOG artifact correction from EEG recording using stationary subspace analysis and 
      empirical mode decomposition.

AB  - Ocular contamination of EEG data is an important and very common problem in the 
      diagnosis of neurobiological events. An effective approach is proposed in this 
      paper to remove ocular artifacts from the raw EEG recording. First, it conducts 
      the blind source separation on the raw EEG recording by the stationary subspace 
      analysis, which can concentrate artifacts in fewer components than the 
      representative blind source separation methods. Next, to recover the neural 
      information that has leaked into the artifactual components, the adaptive signal 
      decomposition technique EMD is applied to denoise the components. Finally, the 
      artifact-only components are projected back to be subtracted from EEG signals to 
      get the clean EEG data. The experimental results on both the artificially 
      contaminated EEG data and publicly available real EEG data have demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular for the cases where limited 
      number of electrodes are used for the recording, as well as when the artifact 
      contaminated signal is highly non-stationary and the underlying sources cannot be 
      assumed to be independent or uncorrelated.

AB  - Current video eye trackers use information about the pupil center to estimate 
      orientation and movement of the eye. While dual Purkinje eye trackers suffer from 
      lens wobble and scleral search coils may be influenced by contact lens slippage 
      directly after saccades, it is not known whether pupil-based eye trackers 
      produces similar artifacts in the data. We recorded eye movements from 
      participants making repetitive, horizontal saccades and compared the movement in 
      the data with pupil- and iris movements extracted from the eye images. Results 
      showed that post-saccadic instabilities clearly exist in data recorded with a 
      pupil-based eye tracker. They also exhibit a high degree of reproducibility 
      across saccades and within participants. While the recorded eye movement data 
      correlated well with the movement of the pupil center, the iris center showed 
      only little post-saccadic movement. This means that the pupil moves relative to 
      the iris during post-saccadic eye movements, and that the eye movement data 
      reflect pupil movement rather than eyeball rotation. Besides introducing 
      inaccuracies and additional variability in the data, the pupil movement inside 
      the eyeball influences the decision of when a saccade should end and the 
      subsequent fixation should begin, and consequently higher order analyses based on 
      fixations and saccades.

PG  - 296

LID - 296
AB  - Imaging the brain during complex and intensive movements is challenging due to 
      the susceptibility of brain-imaging methods for motion and myogenic artifacts. A 
      few studies measured brain activity during either single-joint or low-intensity 
      exercises; however, the cortical activation state during larger movements with 
      increases up to maximal intensity has barely been investigated so far. Eleven 
      right-handed volunteers (22-45 years in age) performed isometric leg extensions 
      with their right leg at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of their maximal voluntary 
      contraction. Contractions were hold for 20 s respectively. 
      Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded. 
      Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used 
      to localize the cortical current density within the premotor (PMC), primary motor 
      (M1), primary somatosensory (S1) and somatosensory association cortex (SAC). 
      ANOVA was used for repeated measures for comparison of intensities and between 
      the left and right hemispheres. The quality of the EEG signal was satisfying up 
      to 80% intensity. At 100% half of the participants were not able to keep their 
      neck and face muscles relaxed, leading to myogenic artifacts. Higher 
      contralateral vs. ipsilateral hemispheric activity was found for the S1, SAC and, 
      PMC. M1 possessed higher ipsilateral activity. The highest activity was localized 
      in the M1, followed by S1, PMC, and SAC. EMG activity and cortical current 
      density within the M1 increased with exercise intensity. EEG recordings during 
      bigger movements up to submaximal intensity (80%) are possible, but maximal 
      intensities are still hard to investigate when subjects contracted their neck and 
      face muscles at the same time. Isometric contractions mainly involve the M1, 
      whereas the S1, PMC, and SAC seem not to be involved in the force output. 
      Limitations and recommendations for future studies are discussed.

TI  - EEG power during waking and NREM sleep in primary insomnia.
PG  - 1031-7
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3076 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathophysiological models of insomnia invoke the concept of 24-hour 
      hyperarousal, which could lead to symptoms and physiological findings during 
      waking and sleep. We hypothesized that this arousal could be seen in the waking 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) of individuals with primary insomnia (PI), and that 
      waking EEG power would correlate with non-REM (NREM) EEG. METHODS: Subjects 
      included 50 PI and 32 good sleeper controls (GSC). Five minutes of eyes closed 
      waking EEG were collected at subjects' usual bedtimes, followed by 
      polysomnography (PSG) at habitual sleep times. An automated algorithm and visual 
      editing were used to remove artifacts from waking and sleep EEGs, followed by 
      power spectral analysis to estimate power from 0.5-32 Hz. RESULTS: We did not 
      find significant differences in waking or NREM EEG spectral power of PI and GSC. 
      Significant correlations between waking and NREM sleep power were observed across 
      all frequency bands in the PI group and in most frequency bands in the GSC group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The absence of significant differences between groups in waking or 
      NREM EEG power suggests that our sample was not characterized by a high degree of 
      cortical arousal. The consistent correlations between waking and NREM EEG power 
      suggest that, in samples with elevated NREM EEG beta activity, waking EEG power 
      may show a similar pattern.

LID - e75816
AB  - The visual system has a remarkable ability to extract categorical information 
      from complex natural scenes. In order to elucidate the role of low-level image 
      features for the recognition of objects in natural scenes, we recorded saccadic 
      eye movements and event-related potentials (ERPs) in two experiments, in which 
      human subjects had to detect animals in previously unseen natural images. We used 
      a new natural image database (ANID) that is free of some of the potential 
      artifacts that have plagued the widely used COREL images. Color and grayscale 
      images picked from the ANID and COREL databases were used. In all experiments, 
      color images induced a greater N1 EEG component at earlier time points than 
      grayscale images. We suggest that this influence of color in animal detection may 
      be masked by later processes when measuring reation times. The ERP results of 
      go/nogo and forced choice tasks were similar to those reported earlier. The 
      non-animal stimuli induced bigger N1 than animal stimuli both in the COREL and 
      ANID databases. This result indicates ultra-fast processing of animal images is 
      possible irrespective of the particular database. With the ANID images, the 
      difference between color and grayscale images is more pronounced than with the 
      COREL images. The earlier use of the COREL images might have led to an 
      underestimation of the contribution of color. Therefore, we conclude that the 
      ANID image database is better suited for the investigation of the processing of 
      natural scenes than other databases commonly used.

AB  - Cognition arises from the transient integration and segregation of activity 
      across functionally distinct brain areas. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), which 
      encompass a wide range of developmental disabilities, have been presumed to be 
      associated with a problem in cortical and sub-cortical dynamics of coordinated 
      activity, often involving enhanced local but decreased long range coordination 
      over areas of integration. In this paper we challenge this idea by presenting 
      results from a relatively large population of ASD children and age-matched 
      controls during a face-processing task. Over most of the explored domain, 
      children with ASD exhibited enhanced synchronization, although finer detail 
      reveals specific enhancement/reduction of synchrony depending on time, frequency 
      and brain site. Our results are derived from the use of the imaginary part of 
      coherency, a measure which is not susceptible to volume conduction artifacts and 
      therefore presents a credible picture of coordinated brain activity. We also 
      present evidence that this measure is a good candidate to provide features in 
      building a classifier to be used as a potential biomarker for autism.

AB  - The removal of spatially correlated noise is an important step in processing 
      multichannel recordings. Here, a technique termed the adaptive common average 
      reference (ACAR) is presented as an effective and simple method for removing this 
      noise. The ACAR is based on a combination of the well-known common average 
      reference (CAR) and an adaptive noise canceling (ANC) filter. In a convergent 
      process, the CAR provides a reference to an ANC filter, which in turn provides 
      feedback to enhance the CAR. This method was effective on both simulated and real 
      data, outperforming the standard CAR when the amplitude or polarity of the noise 
      changes across channels. In many cases, the ACAR even outperformed independent 
      component analysis. On 16 channels of simulated data, the ACAR was able to 
      attenuate up to approximately 290 dB of noise and could improve signal quality if 
      the original SNR was as high as 5 dB. With an original SNR of 0 dB, the ACAR 
      improved signal quality with only two data channels and performance improved as 
      the number of channels increased. It also performed well under many different 
      conditions for the structure of the noise and signals. Analysis of contaminated 
      electrocorticographic recordings further showed the effectiveness of the ACAR.

TI  - Automatic and direct identification of blink components from scalp EEG.
PG  - 10783-801
LID - 10.3390/s130810783 [doi]
AB  - Eye blink is an important and inevitable artifact during scalp 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. The main problem in EEG signal processing 
      is how to identify eye blink components automatically with independent component 
      analysis (ICA). Taking into account the fact that the eye blink as an external 
      source has a higher sum of correlation with frontal EEG channels than all other 
      sources due to both its location and significant amplitude, in this paper, we 
      proposed a method based on correlation index and the feature of power 
      distribution to automatically detect eye blink components. Furthermore, we prove 
      mathematically that the correlation between independent components and scalp EEG 
      channels can be translating directly from the mixing matrix of ICA. This helps to 
      simplify calculations and understand the implications of the correlation. The 
      proposed method doesn't need to select a template or thresholds in advance, and 
      it works without simultaneously recording an electrooculography (EOG) reference. 
      The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically 
      recognize eye blink components with a high accuracy on entire datasets from 15 
      subjects.

TI  - Gyroscope-driven mouse pointer with an EMOTIV® EEG headset and data analysis 
      based on Empirical Mode Decomposition.
PG  - 10561-83
LID - 10.3390/s130810561 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a project on the development of a cursor control emulating 
      the typical operations of a computer-mouse, using gyroscope and eye-blinking 
      electromyographic signals which are obtained through a commercial 16-electrode 
      wireless headset, recently released by Emotiv. The cursor position is controlled 
      using information from a gyroscope included in the headset. The clicks are 
      generated through the user's blinking with an adequate detection procedure based 
      on the spectral-like technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). EMD is 
      proposed as a simple and quick computational tool, yet effective, aimed to 
      artifact reduction from head movements as well as a method to detect blinking 
      signals for mouse control. Kalman filter is used as state estimator for mouse 
      position control and jitter removal. The detection rate obtained in average was 
      94.9%. Experimental setup and some obtained results are presented.

TI  - L1 norm based common spatial patterns decomposition for scalp EEG BCI.
PG  - 77
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-12-77 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain computer interfaces (BCI) is one of the most popular branches 
      in biomedical engineering. It aims at constructing a communication between the 
      disabled persons and the auxiliary equipments in order to improve the patients' 
      life. In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, one of the popular feature extraction 
      strategies is Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). In practical BCI situation, scalp 
      EEG inevitably has the outlier and artifacts introduced by ocular, head motion or 
      the loose contact of electrodes in scalp EEG recordings. Because outlier and 
      artifacts are usually observed with large amplitude, when CSP is solved in view 
      of L2 norm, the effect of outlier and artifacts will be exaggerated due to the 
      imposing of square to outliers, which will finally influence the MI based BCI 
      performance. While L1 norm will lower the outlier effects as proved in other 
      application fields like EEG inverse problem, face recognition, etc. METHODS: In 
      this paper, we present a new CSP implementation using the L1 norm technique, 
      instead of the L2 norm, to solve the eigen problem for spatial filter estimation 
      with aim to improve the robustness of CSP to outliers. To evaluate the 
      performance of our method, we applied our method as well as the standard CSP and 
      the regularized CSP with Tikhonov regularization (TR-CSP), on both the peer BCI 
      dataset with simulated outliers and the dataset from the MI BCI system developed 
      in our group. The McNemar test is used to investigate whether the difference 
      among the three CSPs is of statistical significance. RESULTS: The results of both 
      the simulation and real BCI datasets consistently reveal that the proposed method 
      has much higher classification accuracies than the conventional CSP and the 
      TR-CSP. CONCLUSIONS: By combining L1 norm based Eigen decomposition into Common 
      Spatial Patterns, the proposed approach can effectively improve the robustness of 
      BCI system to EEG outliers and thus be potential for the actual MI BCI 
      application, where outliers are inevitably introduced into EEG recordings.

TI  - Robust neonatal EEG seizure detection through adaptive background modeling.
PG  - 1350018
LID - 10.1142/S0129065713500184 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive probabilistic modeling of the EEG background is proposed for seizure 
      detection in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The decision is made 
      based on the temporal derivative of the seizure probability with respect to the 
      adaptively modeled level of background activity. The robustness of the system to 
      long duration "seizure-like" artifacts, in particular those due to respiration, 
      is improved. The system was developed using statistical leave-one-patient-out 
      performance assessment, on a large clinical dataset, comprising 38 patients of 
      1479 h total duration. The developed technique was then validated by a single 
      test on a separate totally unseen randomized prospective dataset of 51 neonates 
      totaling 2540 h of duration. By exploiting the proposed adaptation, the ROC area 
      is increased from 93.4% to 96.1% (41% relative improvement). The number of false 
      detections per hour is decreased from 0.42 to 0.24, while maintaining the correct 
      detection of seizure burden at 70%. These results on the unseen data were 
      predicted from the rigorous leave-one-patient-out validation and confirm the 
      validity of our algorithm development process.

TI  - Potential for unreliable interpretation of EEG recorded with microelectrodes.
PG  - 1391-401
LID - 10.1111/epi.12202 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent studies in epilepsy, cognition, and brain machine interfaces have 
      shown the utility of recording intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with 
      greater spatial resolution. Many of these studies utilize microelectrodes 
      connected to specialized amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We 
      recently measured the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and 
      demonstrated that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG 
      amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate the 
      clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential 
      difficulties in using microelectrodes. METHODS: Human iEEG data were digitally 
      filtered to simulate the signal recorded by a hybrid grid (two macroelectrodes 
      and eight microelectrodes) connected to a standard EEG amplifier. The filtered 
      iEEG data were read by three trained epileptologists, and high frequency 
      oscillations (HFOs) were detected with a well-known algorithm. The filtering 
      method was verified experimentally by recording an injected EEG signal in a 
      saline bath with the same physical acquisition system used to generate the model. 
      Several electrodes underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM). KEY FINDINGS: 
      Macroelectrode recordings were unaltered compared to the source iEEG signal, but 
      microelectrodes attenuated low frequencies. The attenuated signals were difficult 
      to interpret: all three clinicians changed their clinical scoring of slowing and 
      seizures when presented with the same data recorded on different sized 
      electrodes. The HFO detection algorithm was oversensitive with microelectrodes, 
      classifying many more HFOs than when the same data were recorded with 
      macroelectrodes. In addition, during experimental recordings the microelectrodes 
      produced much greater noise as well as large baseline fluctuations, creating 
      sharply contoured transients, and superimposed "false" HFOs. SEM of these 
      microelectrodes demonstrated marked variability in exposed electrode surface 
      area, lead fractures, and sharp edges. SIGNIFICANCE: Microelectrodes should not 
      be used with low impedance (<1 GΩ) amplifiers due to severe signal attenuation 
      and variability that changes clinical interpretations. The current method of 
      preparing microelectrodes can leave sharp edges and nonuniform amounts of exposed 
      wire. Even when recorded with higher impedance amplifiers, microelectrode data 
      are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to interpret. Great care must be 
      taken when analyzing iEEG from high impedance microelectrodes.

      possibly improvement of motor function in Parkinson's disease; yet, the mechanism 
      of action is unclear. Since Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric diseases are 
      characterized by maladaptive dynamics of brain rhythms, we investigated whether 
      noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation was associated with measurable changes in 
      EEG oscillatory rhythms within theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-10 Hz), high alpha 
      (10.5-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (31-50 Hz) bands. We recorded the EEG 
      while simultaneously delivering noisy bilateral, bipolar stimulation at varying 
      intensities of imperceptible currents - at 10, 26, 42, 58, 74 and 90% of sensory 
      threshold - to ten neurologically healthy subjects. Using standard spectral 
      analysis, we investigated the transient aftereffects of noisy stimulation on 
      rhythms. Subsequently, using robust artifact rejection techniques and the Least 
      Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator regression and cross-validation, we 
      assessed the combinations of channels and power spectral features within each EEG 
      frequency band that were linearly related with stimulus intensity. We show that 
      noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation predominantly leads to a mild suppression 
      of gamma power in lateral regions immediately after stimulation, followed by 
      delayed increase in beta and gamma power in frontal regions approximately 20-25 s 
      after stimulation ceased. Ongoing changes in the power of each oscillatory band 
      throughout frontal, central/parietal, occipital and bilateral electrodes 
      predicted the intensity of galvanic vestibular stimulation in a 
      stimulus-dependent manner, demonstrating linear effects of stimulation on brain 
      rhythms. We propose that modulation of neural oscillations is a potential 
      mechanism for the previously-described cognitive and motor effects of vestibular 
      stimulation, and noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation may provide an additional 
      non-invasive means for neuromodulation of functional brain networks.

AB  - Using EEG, ECoG, MEG, and microelectrodes to record brain activity is prone to 
      multiple artifacts. The main power line (mains line), video equipment, mechanical 
      vibrations and activities outside the brain are the most common sources of 
      artifacts. MEG amplitudes are low, and even small artifacts distort recordings. 
      In this study, we show how these artifacts can be efficiently removed by 
      recording external cues during MEG recordings. These external cues are 
      subsequently used to register the precise times or spectra of the artifacts. The 
      results indicate that these procedures preserve both the spectra and the time 
      domain wave-shapes of the neuromagnetic signal, while successfully reducing the 
      contribution of the artifacts to the target signals without reducing the rank of 
      the data.

AB  - EEG is the most common technique for studying neuronal dynamics of the human 
      brain. However, electromyogenic artifacts from cranial muscles and ocular muscles 
      executing involuntary microsaccades compromise estimates of neuronal activity in 
      the gamma band (>30 Hz). Yet, the relative contributions and practical 
      consequences of these artifacts remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected 
      the effects of these different artifacts on studying visual gamma-band activity 
      with EEG on the sensor and source level, and show strategies to cope with these 
      confounds. We found that cranial muscle activity prevented a direct investigation 
      of neuronal gamma-band activity at the sensor level. Furthermore, we found 
      prolonged microsaccade-related artifacts beyond the well-known transient EEG 
      confounds. We then show that if electromyogenic artifacts are carefully accounted 
      for, the EEG nonetheless allows for studying visual gamma-band activity even at 
      the sensor level. Furthermore, we found that source analysis based on spatial 
      filtering does not only map the EEG signals to the cortical space of interest, 
      but also efficiently accounts for cranial and ocular muscle artifacts. Together, 
      our results clarify the relative contributions and characteristics of myogenic 
      artifacts confounding visual gamma-band activity in EEG, and provide practical 
      guidelines for future experiments.

TI  - Assessing cortical network properties using TMS-EEG.
PG  - 1652-69
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22016 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has seen significant developments in the concurrent use of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to 
      directly assess cortical network properties such as excitability and connectivity 
      in humans. New hardware solutions, improved EEG amplifier technology, and 
      advanced data processing techniques have allowed substantial reduction of the 
      TMS-induced artifact, which had previously rendered concurrent TMS-EEG 
      impossible. Various physiological artifacts resulting from TMS have also been 
      identified, and methods are being developed to either minimize or remove these 
      sources of artifact. With these developments, TMS-EEG has unlocked regions of the 
      cortex to researchers that were previously inaccessible to TMS. By recording the 
      TMS-evoked response directly from the cortex, TMS-EEG provides information on the 
      excitability, effective connectivity, and oscillatory tuning of a given cortical 
      area, removing the need to infer such measurements from indirect measures. In the 
      following review, we investigate the different online and offline methods for 
      reducing artifacts in TMS-EEG recordings and the physiological information 
      contained within the TMS-evoked cortical response. We then address the use of 
      TMS-EEG to assess different cortical mechanisms such as cortical inhibition and 
      neural plasticity, before briefly reviewing studies that have utilized TMS-EEG to 
      explore cortical network properties at rest and during different functional brain 
      states.

AB  - Brain-computer interface is a communication system that connects the brain with 
      computer (or other devices) but is not dependent on the normal output of the 
      brain (i.e., peripheral nerve and muscle). Electro-oculogram is a dominant 
      artifact which has a significant negative influence on further analysis of real 
      electroencephalography data. This paper presented a data adaptive technique for 
      artifact suppression and brain wave extraction from electroencephalography 
      signals to detect regional brain activities. Empirical mode decomposition based 
      adaptive thresholding approach was employed here to suppress the 
      electro-oculogram artifact. Fractional Gaussian noise was used to determine the 
      threshold level derived from the analysis data without any training. The purified 
      electroencephalography signal was composed of the brain waves also called 
      rhythmic components which represent the brain activities. The rhythmic components 
      were extracted from each electroencephalography channel using adaptive wiener 
      filter with the original scale. The regional brain activities were mapped on the 
      basis of the spatial distribution of rhythmic components, and the results showed 
      that different regions of the brain are activated in response to different 
      stimuli. This research analyzed the activities of a single rhythmic component, 
      alpha with respect to different motor imaginations. The experimental results 
      showed that the proposed method is very efficient in artifact suppression and 
      identifying individual motor imagery based on the activities of alpha component.

TI  - Best current practice for obtaining high quality EEG data during simultaneous 
      FMRI.
LID - 10.3791/50283 [doi]
LID - 50283
AB  - Simultaneous EEG-fMRI allows the excellent temporal resolution of EEG to be 
      combined with the high spatial accuracy of fMRI. The data from these two 
      modalities can be combined in a number of ways, but all rely on the acquisition 
      of high quality EEG and fMRI data. EEG data acquired during simultaneous fMRI are 
      affected by several artifacts, including the gradient artefact (due to the 
      changing magnetic field gradients required for fMRI), the pulse artefact (linked 
      to the cardiac cycle) and movement artifacts (resulting from movements in the 
      strong magnetic field of the scanner, and muscle activity). Post-processing 
      methods for successfully correcting the gradient and pulse artifacts require a 
      number of criteria to be satisfied during data acquisition. Minimizing head 
      motion during EEG-fMRI is also imperative for limiting the generation of 
      artifacts. Interactions between the radio frequency (RF) pulses required for MRI 
      and the EEG hardware may occur and can cause heating. This is only a significant 
      risk if safety guidelines are not satisfied. Hardware design and set-up, as well 
      as careful selection of which MR sequences are run with the EEG hardware present 
      must therefore be considered. The above issues highlight the importance of the 
      choice of the experimental protocol employed when performing a simultaneous 
      EEG-fMRI experiment. Based on previous research we describe an optimal 
      experimental set-up. This provides high quality EEG data during simultaneous fMRI 
      when using commercial EEG and fMRI systems, with safety risks to the subject 
      minimized. We demonstrate this set-up in an EEG-fMRI experiment using a simple 
      visual stimulus. However, much more complex stimuli can be used. Here we show the 
      EEG-fMRI set-up using a Brain Products GmbH (Gilching, Germany) MRplus, 32 
      channel EEG system in conjunction with a Philips Achieva (Best, Netherlands) 3T 
      MR scanner, although many of the techniques are transferable to other systems.

TI  - BCG Artifact Removal for Reconstructing Full-scalp EEG inside the MR Scanner.
PG  - 178-181
AB  - In simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition, the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact 
      presents a major challenge for meaningful EEG signal interpretation and needs to 
      be removed. This is very difficult, especially in continuous studies where BCG 
      cannot be removed with averaging. In this study, we take advantage of a 
      high-density EEG-cap and propose an integrated learning and inference approach to 
      estimate the BCG contribution to the overall noisy recording. In particular, we 
      present a special-designed experiment to enable a near-optimal subset selection 
      scheme to identify a small set (20 out of 256 channels), and argue that in 
      real-recording, BCG artifact signal from all channels can be estimated from this 
      set. We call this new approach "Direct Recording Temporal Spatial Encoding" 
      (DRTSE) to reflect these properties. In a preliminary evaluation, the DRTSE is 
      combined with a direct subtraction and an optimization scheme to reconstruct the 
      EEG signal. The performance was compared against the benchmark Optimal Basis Set 
      (OBS) method. In the challenging nonevent-related EEG studies, the DRTSE method, 
      with the optimization-based approach, yields an EEG reconstruction that reduces 
      the normalized RMSE by approximately 13 folds, compared to OBS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complexity in the brain has been well-documented at both neuronal 
      and hemodynamic scales, with increasing evidence supporting its use in 
      sensitively differentiating between mental states and disorders. However, 
      application of complexity measures to fMRI time-series, which are short, sparse, 
      and have low signal/noise, requires careful modality-specific optimization. 
      METHODS: HERE WE USE BOTH SIMULATED AND REAL DATA TO ADDRESS TWO FUNDAMENTAL 
      ISSUES: choice of algorithm and degree/type of signal processing. Methods were 
      evaluated with regard to resilience to acquisition artifacts common to fMRI as 
      well as detection sensitivity. Detection sensitivity was quantified in terms of 
      grey-white matter contrast and overlap with activation. We additionally 
      investigated the variation of complexity with activation and emotional content, 
      optimal task length, and the degree to which results scaled with scanner using 
      the same paradigm with two 3T magnets made by different manufacturers. Methods 
      for evaluating complexity were: power spectrum, structure function, wavelet 
      decomposition, second derivative, rescaled range, Higuchi's estimate of fractal 
      dimension, aggregated variance, and detrended fluctuation analysis. To permit 
      direct comparison across methods, all results were normalized to Hurst exponents. 
      RESULTS: Power-spectrum, Higuchi's fractal dimension, and generalized Hurst 
      exponent based estimates were most successful by all criteria; the 
      poorest-performing measures were wavelet, detrended fluctuation analysis, 
      aggregated variance, and rescaled range. CONCLUSIONS: Functional MRI data have 
      artifacts that interact with complexity calculations in nontrivially distinct 
      ways compared to other physiological data (such as EKG, EEG) for which these 
      measures are typically used. Our results clearly demonstrate that decisions 
      regarding choice of algorithm, signal processing, time-series length, and scanner 
      have a significant impact on the reliability and sensitivity of complexity 
      estimates.

TI  - Detection of Near-Threshold Sounds is Independent of EEG Phase in Common 
      Frequency Bands.
PG  - 262

LID - 262
AB  - Low-frequency oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are thought to 
      reflect periodic excitability changes of large neural networks. Consistent with 
      this notion, detection probability of near-threshold somatosensory, visual, and 
      auditory targets has been reported to co-vary with the phase of oscillations in 
      the EEG. In audition, entrainment of δ-oscillations to the periodic occurrence of 
      sounds has been suggested to function as a mechanism of attentional selection. 
      Here, we examine in humans whether the detection of brief near-threshold sounds 
      in quiet depends on the phase of EEG oscillations. When stimuli were presented at 
      irregular intervals, we did not find a systematic relationship between detection 
      probability and phase. When stimuli were presented at regular intervals (2-s), 
      reaction times were significantly shorter and we observed phase entrainment of 
      EEG oscillations corresponding to the frequency of stimulus presentation 
      (0.5 Hz), revealing an adjustment of the system to the regular stimulation. The 
      amplitude of the entrained oscillation was higher for hits than for misses, 
      suggesting a link between entrainment and stimulus detection. However, detection 
      was independent of phase at frequencies ≥1 Hz. Furthermore, we show that when the 
      data are analyzed using acausal, though common, algorithms, an apparent 
      "entrainment" of the δ-phase to presented stimuli emerges and detection 
      probability appears to depend on δ-phase, similar to reports in the literature. 
      We show that these effects are artifacts from phase distortion at stimulus onset 
      by contamination with the event-related potential, which differs markedly for 
      hits and misses. This highlights the need to carefully deal with this common 
      problem, since otherwise it might bias and mislead this exciting field of 
      research.

LID - e76
AB  - Eye blinks are a pervasive problem in electroencephalography research as they 
      contaminate the brain signal. This paper tests the merits of a software tool 
      employing the regression-based Gratton method that claims to remove the 
      detrimental effects of the eye blink and leaves the activity of the brain. The 
      efficacy of the correction tool was tested on five common stimulus-locked Event 
      Related Potential (ERP) components used in a standard Go/Nogo task. Results 
      suggested that the 'corrected' data could be predicted from data containing no 
      eye blinks, suggesting the tool does not distort the data to great extent. This 
      effect was found significant for all components, except for the P3. The 
      conclusion is that this tool distorts the data at acceptable levels, yet caution 
      should be taken when interpreting later components, like the P3.

TI  - Noise reduction in brainwaves by using both EEG signals and frontal viewing 
      camera images.
PG  - 6272-94
LID - 10.3390/s130506272 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used 
      in various applications, including human-computer interfaces, diagnosis of brain 
      diseases, and measurement of cognitive status. However, EEG signals can be 
      contaminated with noise caused by user's head movements. Therefore, we propose a 
      new method that combines an EEG acquisition device and a frontal viewing camera 
      to isolate and exclude the sections of EEG data containing these noises. This 
      method is novel in the following three ways. First, we compare the accuracies of 
      detecting head movements based on the features of EEG signals in the frequency 
      and time domains and on the motion features of images captured by the frontal 
      viewing camera. Second, the features of EEG signals in the frequency domain and 
      the motion features captured by the frontal viewing camera are selected as 
      optimal ones. The dimension reduction of the features and feature selection are 
      performed using linear discriminant analysis. Third, the combined features are 
      used as inputs to support vector machine (SVM), which improves the accuracy in 
      detecting head movements. The experimental results show that the proposed method 
      can detect head movements with an average error rate of approximately 3.22%, 
      which is smaller than that of other methods.

AB  - EEG recordings made during concurrent fMRI are confounded by the pulse artefact 
      (PA), which although smaller than the gradient artefact is often more problematic 
      because of its variability over multiple cardiac cycles. A better understanding 
      of the PA is needed in order to generate improved methods for reducing its effect 
      in EEG-fMRI experiments. Here we performed a study aimed at identifying the 
      relative contributions of three putative sources of the PA (cardiac-pulse-driven 
      head rotation, the Hall effect due to pulsatile blood flow and pulse-driven 
      expansion of the scalp) to its amplitude and variability. EEG recordings were 
      made from 6 subjects lying in a 3T scanner. Accelerometers were fixed on the 
      forehead and temple to monitor head motion. A bite-bar and vacuum cushion were 
      used to restrain the head, thus greatly attenuating the contribution of 
      cardiac-driven head rotation to the PA, while an insulating layer placed between 
      the head and the EEG electrodes was used to eliminate the Hall voltage 
      contribution. Using the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the PA averaged over 
      leads and time as a measure of the PA amplitude, we found that head restraint and 
      insulating layer reduced the PA by 61% and 42%, respectively, when compared with 
      the PA induced with the subject relaxed, indicating that cardiac-pulse-driven 
      head rotation is the dominant source of the PA. With both the insulating layer 
      and head restraint in place, the PA was reduced in RMS amplitude by 78% compared 
      with the relaxed condition, the remaining PA contribution resulting from scalp 
      expansion or residual head motion. The variance of the PA across cardiac cycles 
      was more strongly reduced by the insulating layer than the head restraint, 
      indicating that the flow-induced Hall voltage makes a larger contribution than 
      pulse-driven head rotation to the variability of the PA.

AB  - Recent advances in sensor and recording technology have allowed scientists to 
      acquire very large time-series datasets. Researchers often analyze these datasets 
      in the context of events, which are intervals of time where the properties of the 
      signal change relative to a baseline signal. We have developed DETECT, a MATLAB 
      toolbox for detecting event time intervals in long, multi-channel time series. 
      Our primary goal is to produce a toolbox that is simple for researchers to use, 
      allowing them to quickly train a model on multiple classes of events, assess the 
      accuracy of the model, and determine how closely the results agree with their own 
      manual identification of events without requiring extensive programming knowledge 
      or machine learning experience. As an illustration, we discuss application of the 
      DETECT toolbox for detecting signal artifacts found in continuous multi-channel 
      EEG recordings and show the functionality of the tools found in the toolbox. We 
      also discuss the application of DETECT for identifying irregular heartbeat 
      waveforms found in electrocardiogram (ECG) data as an additional illustration.

TI  - High-frequency brain activity and muscle artifacts in MEG/EEG: a review and

AB  - In recent years high-frequency brain activity in the gamma-frequency band (30-80 
      Hz) and above has become the focus of a growing body of work in MEG/EEG research. 
      Unfortunately, high-frequency neural activity overlaps entirely with the spectral 
      bandwidth of muscle activity (~20-300 Hz). It is becoming appreciated that 
      artifacts of muscle activity may contaminate a number of non-invasive reports of 
      high-frequency activity. In this review, the spectral, spatial, and temporal 
      characteristics of muscle artifacts are compared with those described (so far) 
      for high-frequency neural activity. In addition, several of the techniques that 
      are being developed to help suppress muscle artifacts in MEG/EEG are reviewed. 
      Suggestions are made for the collection, analysis, and presentation of 
      experimental data with the aim of reducing the number of publications in the 
      future that may contain muscle artifacts.

TI  - Physiological responses to low atmospheric pressure stunning and the implications 
      for welfare.
PG  - 858-68

AB  - In low atmospheric pressure stunning (LAPS), poultry are rendered unconscious 
      before slaughter by gradually reducing oxygen tension in the atmosphere to 
      achieve a progressive anoxia. The effects of LAPS are not instantaneous, so there 
      are legitimate welfare concerns around the experience of birds before loss of 
      consciousness. Using self-contained telemetry logging units, high-quality 
      continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings were 
      obtained from 28 broiler chickens during exposure to LAPS in a commercial poultry 
      processing plant. Application of LAPS was associated with changes in the EEG 
      pattern in the form of increases in total power, decreases in mean frequency, and 
      in particular, increases in slow-wave (delta) activity, indicating a gradual loss 
      of consciousness. Increased delta wave activity was seen within 10 s of LAPS 
      onset and consistently thereafter, peaking at 30 s into LAPS at which point the 
      EEG signal shared characteristics with that of birds in a surgical plane of 
      anesthesia. During LAPS, heart rate consistently decreased, with more pronounced 
      bradycardia and arrhythmia observed after 30 s. No heart rate increases were 
      observed in the period when the birds were potentially conscious. After an 
      initial quiescent period, brief body movements (presumed to be ataxia/loss of 
      posture) were seen on average at 39 s into the LAPS process. Later (after 120 s 
      on average), artifacts related to clonic (wing flapping) and tonic (muscle 
      spasms) convulsions were observed in the EKG recordings. Based on EEG analysis 
      and body movement responses, a conservative estimate of time to loss of 
      consciousness is approximately 40 s. The lack of behavioral responses indicating 
      aversion or escape and absence of heart rate elevation in the conscious period 
      strongly suggest that birds do not find LAPS induction distressing. Collectively, 
      the results suggest that LAPS is a humane approach that has the potential to 
      improve the welfare of poultry at slaughter by gradually inducing unconsciousness 
      without distress, eliminating live shackling and ensuring every bird is 
      adequately stunned before exansguination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We propose a new method for automatic detection of fast ripples (FRs) 
      which have been identified as a potential biomarker of epileptogenic processes. 
      METHODS: This method is based on a two-stage procedure: (i) global detection of 
      events of interest (EOIs, defined as transient signals accompanied with an energy 
      increase in the frequency band of interest 250-600Hz) and (ii) local energy vs. 
      frequency analysis of detected EOIs for classification as FRs, interictal 
      epileptic spikes or artifacts. For this second stage, two variants were 
      implemented based either on Fourier or wavelet transform. The method was 
      evaluated on simulated and real depth-EEG signals (human, animal). The 
      performance criterion was based on receiving operator characteristics. RESULTS: 
      The proposed detector showed high performance in terms of sensitivity and 
      specificity. CONCLUSIONS: As designed to specifically detect FRs, the method 
      outperforms any method simply based on the detection of energy changes in 
      high-pass filtered signals and avoids spurious detections caused by sharp 
      transient events often present in raw signals. SIGNIFICANCE: In most of epilepsy 
      surgery units, huge data sets are generated during pre-surgical evaluation. We 
      think that the proposed detection method can dramatically decrease the workload 
      in assessing the presence of FRs in intracranial EEGs.

TI  - Cross-frequency coupling during isoflurane anaesthesia as revealed by 
      electroencephalographic harmonic wavelet bicoherence.
PG  - 409-19
LID - 10.1093/bja/aes397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fourier bicoherence has previously been applied to investigate phase 
      coupling in the EEG in anaesthesia. However, there are significant theoretical 
      limitations regarding its sensitivity in detecting transient episodes of 
      inter-frequency coupling. Therefore, we used a recently developed wavelet 
      bicoherence method to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in the EEG of 
      patients under isoflurane anaesthesia; examining the relationship between the 
      patterns of wavelet bicoherence and the isoflurane concentrations. METHODS: We 
      analysed a set of previously published EEG data, obtained from 29 patients who 
      underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia. Artifact-free, 
      1 min EEG segments at different isoflurane concentrations were extracted from 
      each subject and the wavelet bicoherence calculated for all pairs of frequencies 
      from 0.5 to 20 Hz. RESULTS: Isoflurane caused two peaks in the α (6-13 Hz) and 
      slow δ (<1 Hz) regions of the bicoherence matrix diagonal. Higher concentrations 
      of isoflurane shifted the α peak to lower frequencies [11.3 (0.9) Hz at 0.3% to 
      7.1 (1.2) Hz at 1.5%], as has been previously observed in the power spectra. 
      Outside the diagonal, we also found a significant α peak that was phase-coupled 
      to the slow δ waves; higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted this peak to 
      lower frequencies [10.8 (1.2) to 7.7 (0.7) Hz]. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane caused 
      cross-frequency coupling between α and slow δ waves. Increasing isoflurane 
      concentration slowed the α frequencies where the coupling had occurred. This 
      phenomenon of α-δ coupling suggests that slow cortical oscillations organize the 
      higher α band activity, which is consistent with other studies in natural sleep.

TI  - Parsing eye-tracking data of variable quality to provide accurate fixation 
      duration estimates in infants and adults.
PG  - 229-50
LID - 10.3758/s13428-012-0245-6 [doi]
AB  - Researchers studying infants' spontaneous allocation of attention have 
      traditionally relied on hand-coding infants' direction of gaze from videos; these 
      techniques have low temporal and spatial resolution and are labor intensive. 
      Eye-tracking technology potentially allows for much more precise measurement of 
      how attention is allocated at the subsecond scale, but a number of technical and 
      methodological issues have given rise to caution about the quality and 
      reliability of high temporal resolution data obtained from infants. We present 
      analyses suggesting that when standard dispersal-based fixation detection 
      algorithms are used to parse eye-tracking data obtained from infants, the results 
      appear to be heavily influenced by interindividual variations in data quality. We 
      discuss the causes of these artifacts, including fragmentary fixations arising 
      from flickery or unreliable contact with the eyetracker and variable degrees of 
      imprecision in reported position of gaze. We also present new algorithms designed 
      to cope with these problems by including a number of new post hoc verification 
      checks to identify and eliminate fixations that may be artifactual. We assess the 
      results of our algorithms by testing their reliability using a variety of methods 
      and on several data sets. We contend that, with appropriate data analysis 
      methods, fixation duration can be a reliable and stable measure in infants. We 
      conclude by discussing ways in which studying fixation durations during 
      unconstrained orienting may offer insights into the relationship between 
      attention and learning in naturalistic settings.

AB  - Existing automatic detection techniques show high sensitivity and moderate 
      specificity, and detect seizures a relatively long time after onset. High 
      frequency (80-500 Hz) activity has recently been shown to be prominent in the 
      intracranial EEG of epileptic patients but has not been used in seizure 
      detection. The purpose of this study is to investigate if these frequencies can 
      contribute to seizure detection. The system was designed using 30 h of 
      intracranial EEG, including 15 seizures in 15 patients. Wavelet decomposition, 
      feature extraction, adaptive thresholding and artifact removal were employed in 
      training data. An EMG removal algorithm was developed based on two features: Lack 
      of correlation between frequency bands and energy-spread in frequency. Results 
      based on the analysis of testing data (36 h of intracranial EEG, including 18 
      seizures) show a sensitivity of 72%, a false detection of 0.7/h and a median 
      delay of 5.7 s. Missed seizures originated mainly from seizures with subtle or 
      absent high frequencies or from EMG removal procedures. False detections were 
      mainly due to weak EMG or interictal high frequency activities. The system 
      performed sufficiently well to be considered for clinical use, despite the 
      exclusive use of frequencies not usually considered in clinical interpretation. 
      High frequencies have the potential to contribute significantly to the detection 
      of epileptic seizures.

TI  - Magnetoencephalography reveals a unique neurophysiological profile of focal-onset 
      epileptic spasms.
PG  - 147-51
AB  - Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring 
      predisposition to experience epileptic seizures and the neurobiological, 
      cognitive, psychological, and social difficulties relating to the condition. An 
      epileptic spasm (ES) is a type of seizure characterized by clusters of short 
      contractions involving axial muscles and proximal segments. However, the precise 
      mechanism of ESs remains unknown. Despite the potential of magnetoencephalography 
      (MEG) as a tool for investigating the neurophysiological mechanism of ESs, it has 
      been difficult to use this methodology due to magnetic artifacts attributable to 
      patient movement. We report on an 8-year-old girl suffering from intractable 
      epileptic spasms from the age of 7 months. She was diagnosed with possible 
      Aicardi syndrome [corrected] (AGS), characterized by the triad of callosal 
      agenesis, infantile spasms, and chorioretinal lacunae. She is now intellectually 
      delayed and suffers from intractable ES. We used both MEG and 
      electroencephalography to investigate her epilepsy. The recording captured two 
      series of spasm clusters. Spikes were clearly identified with MEG in about 
      four-fifths of all spasms but were identified poorly or not at all in the 
      remainder. MEG findings support previous studies that used intracranial 
      electrodes to analyze patients with ESs and that showed variability in 
      ES-associated spikes in terms of manner of cortical involvement and magnitude. 
      Given the limitations of intracranial electrodes, such as sampling restrictions 
      and invasiveness, MEG may be a helpful tool for non-invasively investigating the 
      unique pathophysiological profile of focal-onset ESs.

TI  - Quantitative electroencephalography during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM 
      sleep in combat-exposed veterans with and without post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD), and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have examined 
      sleep quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a technique able to detect 
      subtle differences that polysomnography does not capture. We hypothesized that 
      greater high-frequency qEEG would reflect 'hyperarousal' in combat veterans with 
      PTSD (n = 16) compared to veterans without PTSD (n = 13). EEG power in 
      traditional EEG frequency bands was computed for artifact-free sleep epochs 
      across an entire night. Correlations were performed between qEEG and ratings of 
      PTSD symptoms and combat exposure. The groups did not differ significantly in 
      whole-night qEEG measures for either rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) 
      sleep. Non-significant medium effect sizes suggest less REM beta (opposite to our 
      hypothesis), less REM and NREM sigma and more NREM gamma in combat veterans with 
      PTSD. Positive correlations were found between combat exposure and NREM beta 
      (PTSD group only), and REM and NREM sigma (non-PTSD group only). Results did not 
      support global hyperarousal in PTSD as indexed by increased beta qEEG activity. 
      The correlation of sigma activity with combat exposure in those without PTSD and 
      the non-significant trend towards less sigma activity during both REM and NREM 
      sleep in combat veterans with PTSD suggests that differential information 
      processing during sleep may characterize combat-exposed military veterans with 
      and without PTSD.

PG  - 447-66
LID - 10.1002/hbm.21448 [doi]
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is able to detect changes in blood 
      oxygenation level associated with neuronal activity throughout the brain. For 
      more than a decade, fMRI alone or in combination with simultaneous EEG recording 
      (EEG-fMRI) has been used to investigate the hemodynamic changes associated with 
      interictal and ictal epileptic discharges. This is the first literature review to 
      focus on the various fMRI acquisition and data analysis methods applied to map 
      epileptic seizure-related hemodynamic changes from the first report of an fMRI 
      scan of a seizure to the present day. Two types of data analysis approaches, 
      based on temporal correlation and data driven, are explained and contrasted. The 
      spatial and temporal relationship between the observed hemodynamic changes using 
      fMRI and other non-invasive and invasive electrophysiological and imaging data is 
      considered. We then describe the role of fMRI in localizing and exploring the 
      networks involved in spontaneous and triggered seizure onset and propagation. We 
      also discuss that fMRI alone and combined with EEG hold great promise in the 
      investigation of seizure-related hemodynamic changes non-invasively in humans. We 
      think that this will lead to significant improvements in our understanding of 
      seizures with important consequences for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) can find distinct sources of 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, both brain-based and artifactual, and has 
      become a common pre-preprocessing step in analysis of EEG data. Distinction 
      between brain and non-brain independent components (ICs) accounting for, e.g., 
      eye or muscle activities is an important step in the analysis. Here we present a 
      fully automated method to identify eye-movement related EEG components by 
      analyzing the spatial distribution of their scalp projections (scalp maps). The 
      EyeCatch method compares each input scalp map to a database of eye-related IC 
      scalp maps obtained by data-mining over half a million IC scalp maps obtained 
      from 80,006 EEG datasets associated with a diverse set of EEG studies and 
      paradigms. To our knowledge this is the largest sample of IC scalp maps that has 
      ever been analyzed. Our result show comparable performance to a previous 
      state-of-art semi-automated method, CORRMAP, while eliminating the need for human 
      intervention.

AB  - We present a new method for removing artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) 
      records during Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS). The main challenge in 
      exploiting GVS is to understand how the stimulus acts as an input to brain. We 
      used EEG to monitor the brain and elicit the GVS reflexes. However, GVS current 
      distribution throughout the scalp generates an artifact on EEG signals. We need 
      to eliminate this artifact to be able to analyze the EEG signals during GVS. We 
      propose a novel method to estimate the contribution of the GVS current in the EEG 
      signals at each electrode by combining time-series regression methods with 
      wavelet decomposition methods. We use wavelet transform to project the recorded 
      EEG signal into various frequency bands and then estimate the GVS current 
      distribution in each frequency band. The proposed method was optimized using 
      simulated signals, and its performance was compared to well-accepted artifact 
      removal methods such as ICA-based methods and adaptive filters. The results show 
      that the proposed method has better performance in removing GVS artifacts, 
      compared to the others. Using the proposed method, a higher signal to artifact 
      ratio of -1.625 dB was achieved, which outperformed other methods such as 
      ICA-based methods, regression methods, and adaptive filters.

TI  - Diagnostic value of resting electroencephalogram in 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder across the lifespan.
PG  - 135-51
LID - 10.1007/s10548-012-0258-6 [doi]
AB  - The resting electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects development and arousal, but 
      whether it can support clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) remains controversial. Here we examined whether theta power and 
      theta/beta ratio are consistently elevated in ADHD and younger age as proposed. 
      Topographic 48-channel EEG from 32 children (8-16 years) and 22 adults 
      (32-55 years) with ADHD and matched healthy controls (n = 30 children/21 adults) 
      was compared. Following advanced artefact correction, resting EEG was tested for 
      increased theta and theta/beta activity due to ADHD and due to normal immaturity. 
      Discriminant analyses tested classification performance by ADHD and age using 
      these EEG markers as well as EEG artefacts and deviant attentional event-related 
      potentials (ERPs). No consistent theta or theta/beta increases were found with 
      ADHD. Even multivariate analyses indicated only marginal EEG power increases in 
      children with ADHD. Instead, consistent developmental theta decreases were 
      observed, indicating that maturational lags of fewer than 3 years would have been 
      detected in children. Discriminant analysis based on proposed simple spectral 
      resting EEG markers was successful for age but not for ADHD (81 vs. 53 % 
      accuracy). Including ERP markers and EEG artefacts improved discrimination, 
      although not to diagnostically useful levels. The lack of consistent spectral 
      resting EEG abnormalities in ADHD despite consistent developmental effects casts 
      doubt upon conventional neurometric approaches towards EEG-based ADHD diagnosis, 
      but is consistent with evidence that ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, where the 
      resting state is not consistently characterised by maturational lag.

TI  - A novel method for reducing the effect of tonic muscle activity on the gamma band 
      of the scalp EEG.

AB  - Neural oscillations in the gamma band are of increasing interest, but separating 
      them from myogenic electrical activity has proved difficult. A novel algorithm 
      has been developed to reduce the effect of tonic scalp and neck muscle activity 
      on the gamma band of the EEG. This uses mathematical modelling to fit individual 
      muscle spikes and then subtracts them from the data. The method was applied to 
      the detection of motor associated gamma in two separate groups of eight subjects 
      using different sampling rates. A reproducible increase in high gamma (65-85 Hz) 
      magnitude occurred immediately after the motor action in the left central area 
      (p = 0.02 and p = 0.0002 for the two cohorts with individually optimized 
      algorithm parameters, compared to p = 0.03 and p = 0.16 before correction). 
      Whilst the magnitude of this event-related gamma synchronisation was not reduced 
      by the application of the EMG reduction algorithm, the baseline left central 
      gamma magnitude was significantly reduced by an average of 23 % with a faster 
      sampling rate (p < 0.05). In comparison, at left and right temporo-parietal 
      locations the gamma amplitude was reduced by 60 and 54 % respectively (p < 0.05). 
      The reduction of EMG contamination by fitting and subtraction of individual 
      spikes shows promise as a method of improving the signal to noise ratio of high 
      frequency neural oscillations in scalp EEG.

TI  - An evaluation of in vivo voltage-sensitive dyes: pharmacological side effects and 
      signal-to-noise ratios after effective removal of brain-pulsation artifacts.
PG  - 2931-45
LID - 10.1152/jn.00512.2011 [doi]
AB  - In the current study, we investigated pharmacological side effects and 
      signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of two commonly used voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs): 
      the blue dye RH-1691 (1 mg/ml) and the red dye di-4-ANEPPS (0.1 mg/ml), applied 
      in vivo to the rat barrel cortex. Blue dyes are often favored over red dyes in in 
      vivo studies due to their apparent superior SNR, partly because their 
      fluorescence spectrum is farther away from the hemoglobin absorption spectrum, 
      making them less prone to heartbeat-associated brain-pulsation artifacts (BPA). 
      We implemented a previously reported template-based BPA removal algorithm and 
      evaluated its applicability to di-4-ANEPPS before comparing characteristics of 
      the two dyes. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were also recorded. Whereas 
      SEPs recorded before and after application of di-4-ANEPPS failed to exhibit 
      demonstrable differences, RH-1691 caused a significant and prolonged increase in 
      SEP amplitude for several hours. In contrast, neither dye influenced the 
      spontaneous cortical activity as assessed by the spectral content of the EEG. 
      Both dyes turned out to be strikingly similar with respect to changes in 
      fractional fluorescence as a function of SEP response amplitude, as well as 
      regarding shot noise characteristics after removal of the BPA. Thus there is 
      strong evidence that the increased SNR for RH-1691 is a consequence of an 
      artificially increased signal. When applying an appropriate BPA removal 
      algorithm, di-4-ANEPPS has proven to be suitable for single-trial in vivo VSD 
      imaging (VSDI) and produces no detectable neurophysiological changes in the 
      system under investigation. Taken together, our data argue for a careful 
      re-evaluation of pharmacological side effects of RH-1691 and support the 
      applicability of di-4-ANEPPS for stable single-trial in vivo VSDI recordings.

TI  - Coupling BCI and cortical stimulation for brain-state-dependent stimulation: 
      methods for spectral estimation in the presence of stimulation after-effects.
PG  - 87

LID - 87
AB  - Brain-state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) combines brain-computer interfaces 
      (BCIs) and cortical stimulation into one paradigm that allows the online decoding 
      for example of movement intention from brain signals while simultaneously 
      applying stimulation. If the BCI decoding is performed by spectral features, 
      stimulation after-effects such as artefacts and evoked activity present a 
      challenge for a successful implementation of BSDS because they can impair the 
      detection of targeted brain states. Therefore, efficient and robust methods are 
      needed to minimize the influence of the stimulation-induced effects on spectral 
      estimation without violating the real-time constraints of the BCI. In this work, 
      we compared four methods for spectral estimation with autoregressive (AR) models 
      in the presence of pulsed cortical stimulation. Using combined EEG-TMS 
      (electroencephalography-transcranial magnetic stimulation) as well as combined 
      electrocorticography (ECoG) and epidural electrical stimulation, three patients 
      performed a motor task using a sensorimotor-rhythm BCI. Three stimulation 
      paradigms were varied between sessions: (1) no stimulation, (2) single 
      stimulation pulses applied independently (open-loop), or (3) coupled to the BCI 
      output (closed-loop) such that stimulation was given only while an intention to 
      move was detected using neural data. We found that removing the stimulation 
      after-effects by linear interpolation can introduce a bias in the estimation of 
      the spectral power of the sensorimotor rhythm, leading to an overestimation of 
      decoding performance in the closed-loop setting. We propose the use of the Burg 
      algorithm for segmented data to deal with stimulation after-effects. This work 
      shows that the combination of BCIs controlled with spectral features and cortical 
      stimulation in a closed-loop fashion is possible when the influence of 
      stimulation after-effects on spectral estimation is minimized.

TI  - Localization of dense intracranial electrode arrays using magnetic resonance 
      imaging.
PG  - 157-165
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.039 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial electrode arrays are routinely used in the pre-surgical evaluation 
      of patients with medically refractory epilepsy, and recordings from these 
      electrodes have been increasingly employed in human cognitive neurophysiology due 
      to their high spatial and temporal resolution. For both researchers and 
      clinicians, it is critical to localize electrode positions relative to the 
      subject-specific neuroanatomy. In many centers, a post-implantation MRI is 
      utilized for electrode detection because of its higher sensitivity for surgical 
      complications and the absence of radiation. However, magnetic susceptibility 
      artifacts surrounding each electrode prohibit unambiguous detection of individual 
      electrodes, especially those that are embedded within dense grid arrays. Here, we 
      present an efficient method to accurately localize intracranial electrode arrays 
      based on pre- and post-implantation MR images that incorporates array geometry 
      and the individual's cortical surface. Electrodes are directly visualized 
      relative to the underlying gyral anatomy of the reconstructed cortical surface of 
      individual patients. Validation of this approach shows high spatial accuracy of 
      the localized electrode positions (mean of 0.96 mm ± 0.81 mm for 271 electrodes 
      across 8 patients). Minimal user input, short processing time, and utilization of 
      radiation-free imaging are strong incentives to incorporate quantitatively 
      accurate localization of intracranial electrode arrays with MRI for research and 
      clinical purposes. Co-registration to a standard brain atlas further allows 
      inter-subject comparisons and relation of intracranial EEG findings to the larger 
      body of neuroimaging literature.

AB  - Eye movements introduce large artifacts to electroencephalographic recordings 
      (EEG) and thus render data analysis difficult or even impossible. Trials 
      contaminated by eye movement and blink artifacts have to be discarded, hence in 
      standard EEG-paradigms subjects are required to fixate on the screen. To overcome 
      this restriction, several correction methods including regression and blind 
      source separation have been proposed. Yet, there is no automated standard 
      procedure established. By simultaneously recording eye movements and 
      64-channel-EEG during a guided eye movement paradigm, we investigate and review 
      the properties of eye movement artifacts, including corneo-retinal dipole 
      changes, saccadic spike potentials and eyelid artifacts, and study their 
      interrelations during different types of eye- and eyelid movements. In 
      concordance with earlier studies our results confirm that these artifacts arise 
      from different independent sources and that depending on electrode site, gaze 
      direction, and choice of reference these sources contribute differently to the 
      measured signal. We assess the respective implications for artifact correction 
      methods and therefore compare the performance of two prominent approaches, namely 
      linear regression and independent component analysis (ICA). We show and discuss 
      that due to the independence of eye artifact sources, regression-based correction 
      methods inevitably over- or under-correct individual artifact components, while 
      ICA is in principle suited to address such mixtures of different types of 
      artifacts. Finally, we propose an algorithm, which uses eye tracker information 
      to objectively identify eye-artifact related ICA-components (ICs) in an automated 
      manner. In the data presented here, the algorithm performed very similar to human 
      experts when those were given both, the topographies of the ICs and their 
      respective activations in a large amount of trials. Moreover it performed more 
      reliable and almost twice as effective than human experts when those had to base 
      their decision on IC topographies only. Furthermore, a receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated an optimal balance of false positive 
      and false negative at an area under curve (AUC) of more than 0.99. Removing the 
      automatically detected ICs from the data resulted in removal or substantial 
      suppression of ocular artifacts including microsaccadic spike potentials, while 
      the relevant neural signal remained unaffected. In conclusion the present work 
      aims at a better understanding of individual eye movement artifacts, their 
      interrelations and the respective implications for eye artifact correction. 
      Additionally, the proposed ICA-procedure provides a tool for optimized detection 
      and correction of eye movement-related artifact components.

AB  - Recent studies show that scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a non-invasive 
      interface has great potential for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, one 
      factor that has limited practical applications for EEG-based BCI so far is the 
      difficulty to decode brain signals in a reliable and efficient way. This paper 
      proposes a new robust processing framework for decoding of multi-class motor 
      imagery (MI) that is based on five main processing steps. (i) Raw EEG 
      segmentation without the need of visual artifact inspection. (ii) Considering 
      that EEG recordings are often contaminated not just by electrooculography (EOG) 
      but also other types of artifacts, we propose to first implement an automatic 
      artifact correction method that combines regression analysis with independent 
      component analysis for recovering the original source signals. (iii) The 
      significant difference between frequency components based on event-related (de-) 
      synchronization and sample entropy is then used to find non-contiguous 
      discriminating rhythms. After spectral filtering using the discriminating 
      rhythms, a channel selection algorithm is used to select only relevant channels. 
      (iv) Feature vectors are extracted based on the inter-class diversity and 
      time-varying dynamic characteristics of the signals. (v) Finally, a support 
      vector machine is employed for four-class classification. We tested our proposed 
      algorithm on experimental data that was obtained from dataset 2a of BCI 
      competition IV (2008). The overall four-class kappa values (between 0.41 and 
      0.80) were comparable to other models but without requiring any 
      artifact-contaminated trial removal. The performance showed that multi-class MI 
      tasks can be reliably discriminated using artifact-contaminated EEG recordings 
      from a few channels. This may be a promising avenue for online robust EEG-based 
      BCI applications.

TI  - Non-contact respiration monitoring for in-vivo murine micro computed tomography: 
      characterization and imaging applications.

AB  - A cone beam micro-CT has previously been utilized along with a pressure-tracking 
      respiration sensor to acquire prospectively gated images of both wild-type mice 
      and various adult murine disease models. While the pressure applied to the 
      abdomen of the subject by this sensor is small and is generally without 
      physiological effect, certain disease models of interest, as well as very young 
      animals, are prone to atelectasis with added pressure, or they generate too weak 
      a respiration signal with this method to achieve optimal prospective gating. In 
      this work we present a new fibre-optic displacement sensor which monitors 
      respiratory motion of a subject without requiring physical contact. The sensor 
      outputs an analogue signal which can be used for prospective respiration gating 
      in micro-CT imaging. The device was characterized and compared against a 
      pneumatic air chamber pressure sensor for the imaging of adult wild-type mice. 
      The resulting images were found to be of similar quality with respect to 
      physiological motion blur; the quality of the respiration signal trace obtained 
      using the non-contact sensor was comparable to that of the pressure sensor and 
      was superior for gating purposes due to its better signal-to-noise ratio. The 
      non-contact sensor was then used to acquire in-vivo micro-CT images of a murine 
      model for congenital diaphragmatic hernia and of 11-day-old mouse pups. In both 
      cases, quality CT images were successfully acquired using this new respiration 
      sensor. Despite the presence of beam hardening artefacts arising from the 
      presence of a fibre-optic cable in the imaging field, we believe this new 
      technique for respiration monitoring and gating presents an opportunity for 
      in-vivo imaging of disease models which were previously considered too delicate 
      for established animal handling methods.

AB  - The capacity to focus one's attention for an extended period of time can be 
      increased through training in contemplative practices. However, the cognitive 
      processes engaged during meditation that support trait changes in cognition are 
      not well characterized. We conducted a longitudinal wait-list controlled study of 
      intensive meditation training. Retreat participants practiced focused attention 
      (FA) meditation techniques for three months during an initial retreat. Wait-list 
      participants later undertook formally identical training during a second retreat. 
      Dense-array scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected during 
      6 min of mindfulness of breathing meditation at three assessment points during 
      each retreat. Second-order blind source separation, along with a novel 
      semi-automatic artifact removal tool (SMART), was used for data preprocessing. We 
      observed replicable reductions in meditative state-related beta-band power 
      bilaterally over anteriocentral and posterior scalp regions. In addition, 
      individual alpha frequency (IAF) decreased across both retreats and in direct 
      relation to the amount of meditative practice. These findings provide evidence 
      for replicable longitudinal changes in brain oscillatory activity during 
      meditation and increase our understanding of the cortical processes engaged 
      during meditation that may support long-term improvements in cognition.

TI  - Influence of dense-array EEG cap on fMRI signal.
PG  - 807-15
LID - 10.1002/mrm.23299 [doi]
AB  - Dense-array (>64 channel) electroencephalography (EEG) systems are increasingly 
      being used in simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      studies. However, with increasing channel count, dense-array EEG caps can induce 
      more severe signal dropout in the MRI images than conventional systems due to the 
      radiofrequency shielding effect of the denser wire bundle. This study 
      investigates the influence of a 256-channel EEG cap on MRI image quality and 
      detection sensitivity of blood oxygen level dependent fMRI signal. A theoretical 
      model is first established to describe the impact of the EEG cap on anatomic 
      signal, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio of blood oxygen 
      level dependent signal. Seven subjects were scanned to measure and compare the 
      T(2)-weighted image quality and fMRI detection sensitivity with and without the 
      EEG cap using an auditory/visual/sensorimotor task. The results show that the 
      dense-array EEG cap can substantially reduce the anatomic signal in the brain 
      areas (visual cortex) near the conducting wires (average percent decrease ≈ 38%). 
      However, the image signal-to-noise ratio with and without the EEG cap was 
      comparable (percent decrease < 8%, not statistically significant), and there was 
      no statistically significant difference in the extent of blood oxygen level 
      dependent activation. This suggests that the ability to detect fMRI signal is 
      nearly unaffected by dense-array EEG caps in simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments.

TI  - Improved electrically evoked auditory steady-state response thresholds in humans.
PG  - 573-89
LID - 10.1007/s10162-012-0321-8 [doi]
AB  - Electrically evoked auditory steady-state responses (EASSRs) are EEG potentials 
      in response to periodic electrical stimuli presented through a cochlear implant. 
      For low-rate pulse trains in the 40-Hz range, electrophysiological thresholds 
      derived from response amplitude growth functions correlate well with behavioral T 
      levels at these rates. The aims of this study were: (1) to improve the 
      correlation between electrophysiological thresholds and behavioral T levels at 
      900 pps by using amplitude-modulated (AM) and pulse-width-modulated (PWM) 
      high-rate pulse trains, (2) to develop and evaluate the performance of a new 
      statistical method for response detection which is robust in the presence of 
      stimulus artifacts, and (3) to assess the ability of this statistical method to 
      determine reliable electrophysiological thresholds without any stimulus artifact 
      removal. For six users of a Nucleus cochlear implant and a total of 12 
      stimulation electrode pairs, EASSRs to symmetric biphasic bipolar pulse trains 
      were recorded with seven scalp electrodes. Responses to six different stimuli 
      were analyzed: two low-rate pulse trains with pulse rates in the 40-Hz range as 
      well as two AM and two PWM high-rate pulse trains with a carrier rate of 900 pps 
      and modulation frequencies in the 40-Hz range. Responses were measured at eight 
      different stimulus intensities for each stimulus and stimulation electrode pair. 
      Artifacts due to the electrical stimulation were removed from the recordings. To 
      determine the presence of a neural response, a new statistical method based on a 
      two-sample Hotelling T (2) test was used. Measurements from different recording 
      electrodes and adjacent stimulus intensities were combined to increase 
      statistical power. The results show that EASSRs to modulated high-rate pulse 
      trains account for some of the temporal effects at 900 pps and result in improved 
      electrophysiological thresholds that correlate very well with behavioral T levels 
      at 900 pps. The proposed statistical method for response detection based on a 
      two-sample Hotelling T (2) test has comparable performance to previously used 
      one-sample tests and does not require stimulus artifacts to be removed from the 
      EEG signal for the determination of reliable electrophysiological thresholds.

TI  - A methodology for detecting field potentials from the external ear canal: NEER 
      and EVestG.
PG  - 1835-50
LID - 10.1007/s10439-012-0526-3 [doi]
AB  - An algorithm called the neural event extraction routine (NEER) and a method 
      called Electrovestibulography (EVestG) for extracting field potentials (FPs) from 
      artefact rich and noisy ear canal recordings is presented. Averaged FP waveforms 
      can be used to aid detection of acoustic and or vestibular pathologies. FPs were 
      recorded in the external ear canal proximal to the ear drum. These FPs were 
      extracted using an algorithm called NEER. NEER utilises a modified complex Morlet 
      wavelet analysis of phase change across multiple scales and a template matching 
      (matched filter) methodology to detect FPs buried in noise and biological and 
      environmental artefacts. Initial simulation with simulated FPs shows NEER detects 
      FPs down to -30 dB SNR (power) but only 13-23% of those at SNR's <-6 dB. This was 
      deemed applicable to longer duration recordings wherein averaging could be 
      applied as many FPs are present. NEER was applied to detect both spontaneous and 
      whole body tilt evoked FPs. By subtracting the averaged tilt FP response from the 
      averaged spontaneous FP response it is believed this difference is more 
      representative of the vestibular response. Significant difference (p < 0.05) 
      between up and down whole body (supine and sitting) movements was achieved. 
      Pathologic and physiologic evidence in support of a vestibular and acoustic 
      origin is also presented.

TI  - Automatic artefact removal in a self-paced hybrid brain- computer interface 
      system.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-9-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel artefact removal algorithm is proposed for a self-paced 
      hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This hybrid system combines a 
      self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a virtual keyboard. To select a 
      letter, the user must gaze at the target for at least a specific period of time 
      (dwell time) and then activate the BCI by performing a mental task. 
      Unfortunately, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often contaminated with 
      artefacts. Artefacts change the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade 
      the BCI's performance. METHODS: To remove artefacts in EEG signals, the proposed 
      algorithm uses the stationary wavelet transform combined with a new adaptive 
      thresholding mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and 
      other artefact handling/removal methods, semi-simulated EEG signals (i.e., real 
      EEG signals mixed with simulated artefacts) and real EEG signals obtained from 
      seven participants are used. For real EEG signals, the hybrid BCI system's 
      performance is evaluated in an online-like manner, i.e., using the continuous 
      data from the last session as in a real-time environment. RESULTS: With 
      semi-simulated EEG signals, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves lower 
      signal distortion in both time and frequency domains. With real EEG signals, we 
      demonstrate that for dwell time of 0.0s, the number of false-positives/minute is 
      2 and the true positive rate (TPR) achieved by the proposed algorithm is 44.7%, 
      which is more than 15.0% higher compared to other state-of-the-art artefact 
      handling methods. As dwell time increases to 1.0s, the TPR increases to 73.1%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed artefact removal algorithm greatly improves the BCI's 
      performance. It also has the following advantages: a) it does not require 
      additional electrooculogram/electromyogram channels, long data segments or a 
      large number of EEG channels, b) it allows real-time processing, and c) it 
      reduces signal distortion.

TI  - Weighted phase lag index stability as an artifact resistant measure to detect 
      cognitive EEG activity during locomotion.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-9-47 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-density electroencephalography (EEG) with active electrodes 
      allows for monitoring of electrocortical dynamics during human walking but 
      movement artifacts have the potential to dominate the signal. One potential 
      method for recovering cognitive brain dynamics in the presence of gait-related 
      artifact is the Weighted Phase Lag Index. METHODS: We tested the ability of 
      Weighted Phase Lag Index to recover event-related potentials during locomotion. 
      Weighted Phase Lag Index is a functional connectivity measure that quantified how 
      consistently 90° (or 270°) phase 'lagging' one EEG signal was compared to 
      another. 248-channel EEG was recorded as eight subjects performed a visual 
      oddball discrimination and response task during standing and walking (0.8 or 
      1.2 m/s) on a treadmill. RESULTS: Applying Weighted Phase Lag Index across 
      channels we were able to recover a p300-like cognitive response during walking. 
      This response was similar to the classic amplitude-based p300 we also recovered 
      during standing. We also showed that the Weighted Phase Lag Index detects more 
      complex and variable activity patterns than traditional voltage-amplitude 
      measures. This variability makes it challenging to compare brain activity over 
      time and across subjects. In contrast, a statistical metric of the index's 
      variability, calculated over a moving time window, provided a more generalized 
      measure of behavior. Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability returned a peak change of 
      1.8% + -0.5% from baseline for the walking case and 3.9% + -1.3% for the standing 
      case. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both Weighted Phase Lag Index and 
      Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability have potential for the on-line analysis of 
      cognitive dynamics within EEG during human movement. The latter may be more 
      useful from extracting general principles of neural behavior across subjects and 
      conditions.

TI  - Detection and classification of subject-generated artifacts in EEG signals using 
      autoregressive models.
PG  - 181-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.05.017 [doi]
AB  - We examine the problem of accurate detection and classification of artifacts in 
      continuous EEG recordings. Manual identification of artifacts, by means of an 
      expert or panel of experts, can be tedious, time-consuming and infeasible for 
      large datasets. We use autoregressive (AR) models for feature extraction and 
      characterization of EEG signals containing several kinds of subject-generated 
      artifacts. AR model parameters are scale-invariant features that can be used to 
      develop models of artifacts across a population. We use a support vector machine 
      (SVM) classifier to discriminate among artifact conditions using the AR model 
      parameters as features. Results indicate reliable classification among several 
      different artifact conditions across subjects (approximately 94%). These results 
      suggest that AR modeling can be a useful tool for discriminating among artifact 
      signals both within and across individuals.

TI  - Recording human electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals for neuroscientific research 
      and real-time functional cortical mapping.
LID - 3993 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/3993 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually 
      based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), 
      magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques 
      have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from 
      low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are 
      suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the 
      underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of 
      electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally 
      high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high 
      spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., <1 cm/<1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG 
      involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are 
      implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that 
      ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about 
      task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing 
      and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high 
      gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a 
      robust and general indicator of local cortical function. ECoG can also reveal 
      functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, 
      thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has 
      especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing (BCI) 
      technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication 
      and control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of 
      the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to 
      record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to 
      localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human 
      ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate 
      how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical 
      mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software 
      platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for real-time mapping of brain 
      functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use 
      to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical 
      stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients with drug-resistant partial 
      epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to 
      minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo 
      monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the 
      epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., 
      eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. 
      To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, 
      electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. 
      A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter 
      (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 
      1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The 
      locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and 
      neurosurgeons, and are based on previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of 
      the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous 
      recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and 
      electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map 
      eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the 
      electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In 
      addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a 
      unique opportunity to acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The 
      decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned 
      location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on 
      neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is 
      predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and 
      is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, 
      the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review 
      board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, 
      and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some 
      or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of 
      the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent 
      seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. 
      At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, 
      clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel 
      Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in 
      collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of 
      Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes are fed simultaneously to the 
      research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the 
      clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems 
      typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is 
      sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research 
      or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant 
      from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the 
      research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp 
      amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they 
      are safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low 
      noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are 
      found, and they come with an SDK that allows them to be integrated with 
      custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal 
      accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than 
      that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A 
      built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than 
      the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with 
      a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). 
      Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), 
      data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or 
      video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular 
      experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the 
      different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are 
      accomplished using our BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available 
      general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, 
      processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be 
      flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by 
      researchers' own code in C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules 
      that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module 
      that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware 
      systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts 
      relevant ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an Application 
      module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module 
      that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different 
      experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments 
      will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. 
      However, we usually begin our experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling 
      For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects 
      and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting 
      functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and 
      may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by 
      electrocortical stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold standard 
      for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of ECS mapping is 
      time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. 
      Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an 
      initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and 
      refined by ECS. The results from our passive SIGFRIED mapping technique have been 
      shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS 
      mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology 
      for gathering human ECoG data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments 
      can be initiated using the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific 
      example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the 
      BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.

AB  - In the present study we investigate the communication of different large scale 
      brain sites during an overt language production task with state of the art 
      methods for the estimation of EEG functional connectivity. Participants performed 
      a semantic blocking task in which objects were named in semantically homogeneous 
      blocks of trials consisting of members of a semantic category (e.g., all objects 
      are tools) or in heterogeneous blocks, consisting of unrelated objects. The 
      classic pattern of slower naming times in the homogeneous relative to 
      heterogeneous blocks is assumed to reflect the duration of lexical selection. For 
      the collected data in the homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions the imaginary 
      part of coherency (ImC) was evaluated at different frequencies. The ImC is a 
      measure for detecting the coupling of different brain sites acting on sensor 
      level. Most importantly, the ImC is robust to the artifact of volume conduction. 
      We analyzed the ImC at all pairs of 56 EEG channels across all frequencies. 
      Contrasting the two experimental conditions we found pronounced differences in 
      the theta band at 7 Hz and estimated the most dominant underlying brain sources 
      via a minimum norm inverse solution based on the ImC. As a result of the source 
      localization, we observed connectivity between occipito-temporal and frontal 
      areas, which are well-known to play a major role in lexical-semantic language 
      processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of investigating interactive 
      brain activity during overt language production.

TI  - Artefacts in the amplitude-integrated EEG background pattern of a full-term

AB  - The amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is used to detect neonatal seizures in 
      neonates with asphyxia, and despite limited data-information compared with 
      standard EEG, aEEG is increasingly used as routine monitoring in neonatal 
      intensive care units due to the logistic advantages. In addition, the aEEG 
      background is of prognostic value in these infants. However, aEEG artefacts can 
      lead to an erroneous interpretation of the background pattern. We report a 
      full-term infant with severe perinatal asphyxia with diaphragm spasms that caused 
      a significant alteration in aEEG background pattern. After administration of a 
      neuromuscular blocker, the aEEG background transformed from discontinuous 
      low-voltage pattern to a flat trace. The aEEG background pattern can be 
      misinterpreted by electrical activity of non-cerebral origin. Administration of 
      neuromuscular blockers is a rapid method to differentiate between cerebral and 
      muscular activity on the aEEG when EEG is not (yet) available.

TI  - SigMate: a Matlab-based automated tool for extracellular neuronal signal 
      processing and analysis.
PG  - 97-112
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.03.009 [doi]
AB  - Rapid advances in neuronal probe technology for multisite recording of brain 
      activity have posed a significant challenge to neuroscientists for processing and 
      analyzing the recorded signals. To be able to infer meaningful conclusions 
      quickly and accurately from large datasets, automated and sophisticated signal 
      processing and analysis tools are required. This paper presents a Matlab-based 
      novel tool, "SigMate", incorporating standard methods to analyze spikes and EEG 
      signals, and in-house solutions for local field potentials (LFPs) analysis. 
      Available modules at present are - 1. In-house developed algorithms for: data 
      display (2D and 3D), file operations (file splitting, file concatenation, and 
      file column rearranging), baseline correction, slow stimulus artifact removal, 
      noise characterization and signal quality assessment, current source density 
      (CSD) analysis, latency estimation from LFPs and CSDs, determination of cortical 
      layer activation order using LFPs and CSDs, and single LFP clustering; 2. 
      Existing modules: spike detection, sorting and spike train analysis, and EEG 
      signal analysis. SigMate has the flexibility of analyzing multichannel signals as 
      well as signals from multiple recording sources. The in-house developed tools for 
      LFP analysis have been extensively tested with signals recorded using standard 
      extracellular recording electrode, and planar and implantable multi transistor 
      array (MTA) based neural probes. SigMate will be disseminated shortly to the 
      neuroscience community under the open-source GNU-General Public License.

LID - 17
AB  - Recent advances in data monitoring and sensor technology have accelerated the 
      acquisition of very large data sets. Streaming data sets from instrumentation 
      such as multi-channel EEG recording usually must undergo substantial 
      pre-processing and artifact removal. Even when using automated procedures, most 
      scientists engage in laborious manual examination and processing to assure high 
      quality data and to indentify interesting or problematic data segments. 
      Researchers also do not have a convenient method of method of visually assessing 
      the effects of applying any stage in a processing pipeline. EEGVIS is a MATLAB 
      toolbox that allows users to quickly explore multi-channel EEG and other large 
      array-based data sets using multi-scale drill-down techniques. Customizable 
      summary views reveal potentially interesting sections of data, which users can 
      explore further by clicking to examine using detailed viewing components. The 
      viewer and a companion browser are built on our MoBBED framework, which has a 
      library of modular viewing components that can be mixed and matched to best 
      reveal structure. Users can easily create new viewers for their specific data 
      without any programming during the exploration process. These viewers 
      automatically support pan, zoom, resizing of individual components, and cursor 
      exploration. The toolbox can be used directly in MATLAB at any stage in a 
      processing pipeline, as a plug-in for EEGLAB, or as a standalone precompiled 
      application without MATLAB running. EEGVIS and its supporting packages are freely 
      available under the GNU general public license at

TI  - Multiweek resting EEG cordance change patterns from repeated olfactory activation 
      with two constitutionally salient homeopathic remedies in healthy young adults.
PG  - 445-53
LID - 10.1089/acm.2011.0931 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers psychophysiologic tools to 
      improve sensitivity for detecting objective effects in complementary and 
      alternative medicine. This current investigation extended prior clinical research 
      studies to evaluate effects of one of two different homeopathic remedies on 
      resting EEG cordance after an olfactory activation protocol on healthy young 
      adults with remedy-relevant, self-perceived characteristics. METHODS: 
      Ninety-seven (7) young adults (N=97, mean age 19 years, 55% women) with good 
      self-rated global health and screened for homeopathic constitutional types 
      consistent with one of two remedies (either Sulphur or Pulsatilla) underwent 
      three weekly laboratory sessions. At each visit, subjects had 5-minute resting, 
      eyes-closed EEG recordings before and after a placebo-controlled olfactory 
      activation task with their constitutionally relevant verum remedy. One remedy 
      potency (6c, 12c, or 30c) used per week, was presented in a randomized order over 
      the 3 sessions. Prefrontal resting EEG cordance values at Fp1 and Fp2 were 
      computed from artifact-free 2-minute EEG samples from the presniffing and 
      postsniffing rest periods. Cordance derives from an algorithm that incorporates 
      absolute and relative EEG values. RESULTS: The data showed significant two-way 
      oscillatory interactions of remedy by time for ß, α, θ, and δ cordance, 
      controlling for gender and chemical sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: EEG cordance 
      provided a minimally invasive technique for assessing objective nonlinear 
      physiologic effects of two different homeopathic remedies salient to the 
      individuals who received them. Time factors modulated the direction of effects. 
      Given previous evidence of correlations between cordance and single-photon 
      emission computed tomography, these findings encourage additional neuroimaging 
      research on nonlinear psychophysiologic effects of specific homeopathic remedies.

TI  - A nonparametric feature for neonatal EEG seizure detection based on a 
      representation of pseudo-periodicity.
PG  - 437-46
LID - 10.1016/j.medengphy.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - Automated methods of neonatal EEG seizure detection attempt to highlight the 
      evolving, stereotypical, pseudo-periodic, nature of EEG seizure while rejecting 
      the nonstationary, modulated, coloured stochastic background in the presence of 
      various EEG artefacts. An important aspect of neonatal seizure detection is, 
      therefore, the accurate representation and detection of pseudo-periodicity in the 
      neonatal EEG. This paper describes a method of detecting pseudo-periodic 
      components associated with neonatal EEG seizure based on a novel signal 
      representation; the nonstationary frequency marginal (NFM). The NFM can be 
      considered as an alternative time-frequency distribution (TFD) frequency 
      marginal. This method integrates the TFD along data-dependent, time-frequency 
      paths that are automatically extracted from the TFD using an edge linking 
      procedure and has the advantage of reducing the dimension of a TFD. The reduction 
      in dimension simplifies the process of estimating a decision statistic designed 
      for the detection of the pseudo-periodicity associated with neonatal EEG seizure. 
      The use of the NFM resulted in a significant detection improvement compared to 
      existing stationary and nonstationary methods. The decision statistic estimated 
      using the NFM was then combined with a measurement of EEG amplitude and nominal 
      pre- and post-processing stages to form a seizure detection algorithm. This 
      algorithm was tested on a neonatal EEG database of 18 neonates, 826 h in length 
      with 1389 seizures, and achieved comparable performance to existing second 
      generation algorithms (a median receiver operating characteristic area of 0.902; 
      IQR 0.835-0.943 across 18 neonates).

TI  - Detection of epileptic activity in fMRI without recording the EEG.
PG  - 1867-79
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.083 [doi]
AB  - EEG-fMRI localizes epileptic foci by detecting cerebral hemodynamic changes that 
      are correlated to epileptic events visible in EEG. However, scalp EEG is 
      insensitive to activity restricted to deep structures and recording the EEG in 
      the scanner is complex and results in major artifacts that are difficult to 
      remove. This study presents a new framework for identifying the BOLD 
      manifestations of epileptic discharges without having to record the EEG. The 
      first stage is based on the detection of epileptic events for each voxel by 
      sparse representation in the wavelet domain. The second stage is to gather voxels 
      according to proximity in time and space of detected activities. This technique 
      was evaluated on data generated by superposing artificial responses at different 
      locations and responses amplitude in the brain for 6 control subject runs. The 
      method was able to detect effectively and consistently for responses amplitude of 
      at least 1% above baseline. 46 runs from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were 
      investigated. The results demonstrate that the method detected at least one 
      concordant event in 37/41 runs. The maps of activation obtained from our method 
      were more similar to those obtained by EEG-fMRI than to those obtained by the 
      other method used in this context, 2D-Temporal Cluster Analysis. For 5 runs 
      without event read on scalp EEG, 3 runs showed an activation concordant with the 
      patient's diagnostic. It may therefore be possible, at least when spikes are 
      infrequent, to detect their BOLD manifestations without having to record the EEG.

TI  - Effect of sugammadex or neostigmine neuromuscular block reversal on bispectral 
      index monitoring of propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia.
PG  - 602-6
LID - 10.1093/bja/aer495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a modified γ-cyclodextrin with a novel mechanism of 
      action for reversing the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium. 
      Bispectral index (BIS) is an EEG-derived measure which can be sensitive to 
      frontal electromyographic (EMG) artifacts. We compared BIS values before and 
      after sugammadex or neostigmine neuromuscular block (NMB) reversal in patients 
      with or without high EMG activity. METHODS: During stable propofol/remifentanil 
      anaesthesia and rocuronium-induced block, 48 patients were randomly allocated to 
      receive sugammadex 4 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 μg kg(-1)/glycopyrrolate 10 μg 
      kg(-1), 10 min after the end of surgery. RESULTS: Five minutes after sugammadex 
      administration, mean BIS 50.1 (10.3) increased (P=0.018) to 61.7 (7.9) in 11 
      patients with high EMG activity. In contrast, BIS 49.3 (4.9) remained at 51.9 
      (5.4) in 13 patients who had no EMG activity. Fifteen minutes after neostigmine 
      administration, mean BIS 51.9 (8.1) increased (P=0.007) to 63.9 (8.1) in 13 
      patients who had reappearance of muscle activity. However, in 11 patients who had 
      no EMG activity, BIS 52.3 (7.4) remained at 53.3 (6.8). There was no significant 
      difference between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups over time. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We have shown that reversal of NMB with sugammadex or neostigmine increased BIS 
      values dependent on the presence of EMG activity. Thus, the effect of muscle 
      activity reappearance during rocuronium NMB reversal spuriously increasing the 
      BIS value should be taken into consideration when relying on BIS monitoring for 
      evaluating propofol/remifentanil recovery.

TI  - A tunable support vector machine assembly classifier for epileptic seizure 
      detection.
PG  - 3925-3938
AB  - Automating the detection of epileptic seizures could reduce the significant human 
      resources necessary for the care of patients suffering from intractable epilepsy 
      and offer improved solutions for closed-loop therapeutic devices such as 
      implantable electrical stimulation systems. While numerous detection algorithms 
      have been published, an effective detector in the clinical setting remains 
      elusive. There are significant challenges facing seizure detection algorithms. 
      The epilepsy EEG morphology can vary widely among the patient population. EEG 
      recordings from the same patient can change over time. EEG recordings can be 
      contaminated with artifacts that often resemble epileptic seizure activity. In 
      order for an epileptic seizure detector to be successful, it must be able to 
      adapt to these different challenges. In this study, a novel detector is proposed 
      based on a support vector machine assembly classifier (SVMA). The SVMA consists 
      of a group of SVMs each trained with a different set of weights between the 
      seizure and non-seizure data and the user can selectively control the output of 
      the SVMA classifier. The algorithm can improve the detection performance compared 
      to traditional methods by providing an effective tuning strategy for specific 
      patients. The proposed algorithm also demonstrates a clear advantage over 
      threshold tuning. When compared with the detection performances reported by other 
      studies using the publicly available epilepsy dataset hosted by the University of 
      BONN, the proposed SVMA detector achieved the best total accuracy of 98.72%. 
      These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SVMA detector and its 
      potential in the clinical setting.

TI  - Clinical utility of interictal high-frequency oscillations recorded with subdural 
      macroelectrodes in partial epilepsy.
PG  - 22-34
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2012.8.1.22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is growing interest in high-frequency oscillations 
      (HFO) as electrophysiological biomarkers of the epileptic brain. We evaluated the 
      clinical utility of interictal HFO events, especially their occurrence rates, by 
      comparing the spatial distribution with a clinically determined epileptogenic 
      zone by using subdural macroelectrodes. METHODS: We obtained intracranial 
      electroencephalogram data with a high temporal resolution (2000 Hz sampling rate, 
      0.05-500 Hz band-pass filter) from seven patients with medically refractory 
      epilepsy. Three epochs of 5-minute, artifact-free data were selected randomly 
      from the interictal period. HFO candidates were first detected by an automated 
      algorithm and subsequently screened to discard false detections. Validated events 
      were further categorized as fast ripple (FR) and ripple (R) according to their 
      spectral profiles. The occurrence rate of HFOs was calculated for each electrode 
      contact. An HFO events distribution map (EDM) was constructed for each patient to 
      allow visualization of the spatial distribution of their HFO events. RESULTS: The 
      subdural macroelectrodes were capable of detecting both R and FR events from the 
      epileptic neocortex. The occurrence rate of HFO events, both FR and R, was 
      significantly higher in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than in other brain regions. 
      Patient-specific HFO EDMs can facilitate the identification of the location of 
      HFO-generating tissue, and comparison with findings from ictal recordings can 
      provide additional useful information regarding the epileptogenic zone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of interictal HFOs was reasonably consistent with 
      the SOZ. The detection of HFO events and construction of spatial distribution 
      maps appears to be useful for the presurgical mapping of the epileptogenic zone.

PG  - 3088-94
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5827-11.2012 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have revealed traveling waves of activity in sensory cortex, 
      both following sensory stimulation and during ongoing activity. We contributed to 
      this body of work by measuring the spike-triggered average of the local field 
      potential (stLFP) at multiple concurrent locations (Nauhaus et al., 2009) in the 
      visual cortex of anesthetized cats and macaques. We found the stLFP to be 
      progressively delayed at increasing distances from the site of the triggering 
      spikes, and interpreted this as a traveling wave of depolarization originating 
      from that site. Our results were criticized, however, on two grounds. First, a 
      study using the same recording techniques in the visual cortex of awake macaques 
      reported an apparent lack of traveling waves, and proposed that traveling waves 
      could arise artifactually from excessive filtering of the field potentials (Ray 
      and Maunsell, 2011). Second, the interpretability of the stLFP was questioned 
      (Kenneth Miller, personal communication), as the stLFP must reflect not only 
      interactions between spike trains and field potentials, but also correlations 
      within and across the spike trains. Here, we show that our data and 
      interpretation are not imperiled by these criticisms. We reanalyzed our field 
      potentials to remove any possible artifact due to filtering and to discount the 
      effects of correlations within and across the triggering spike trains. In both 
      cases, we found that the traveling waves were still present. In fact, closer 
      inspection of Ray and Maunsell's (2011) data from awake cortex shows that they do 
      agree with ours, as they contain clear evidence for traveling waves.

TI  - Is that a belt or a snake? Object attentional selection affects the early stages 
      of visual sensory processing.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-8-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is at present crescent empirical evidence deriving from 
      different lines of ERPs research that, unlike previously observed, the earliest 
      sensory visual response, known as C1 component or P/N80, generated within the 
      striate cortex, might be modulated by selective attention to visual stimulus 
      features. Up to now, evidence of this modulation has been related to space 
      location, and simple features such as spatial frequency, luminance, and texture. 
      Additionally, neurophysiological conditions, such as emotion, vigilance, the 
      reflexive or voluntary nature of input attentional selection, and workload have 
      also been related to C1 modulations, although at least the workload status has 
      received controversial indications. No information is instead available, at 
      present, for objects attentional selection. METHODS: In this study object- and 
      space-based attention mechanisms were conjointly investigated by presenting 
      complex, familiar shapes of artefacts and animals, intermixed with distracters, 
      in different tasks requiring the selection of a relevant target-category within a 
      relevant spatial location, while ignoring the other shape categories within this 
      location, and, overall, all the categories at an irrelevant location. EEG was 
      recorded from 30 scalp electrode sites in 21 right-handed participants. RESULTS 
      AND CONCLUSIONS: ERP findings showed that visual processing was modulated by both 
      shape- and location-relevance per se, beginning separately at the latency of the 
      early phase of a precocious negativity (60-80 ms) at mesial scalp sites 
      consistent with the C1 component, and a positivity at more lateral sites. The 
      data also showed that the attentional modulation progressed conjointly at the 
      latency of the subsequent P1 (100-120 ms) and N1 (120-180 ms), as well as 
      later-latency components. These findings support the views that (1) V1 may be 
      precociously modulated by direct top-down influences, and participates to object, 
      besides simple features, attentional selection; (2) object spatial and 
      non-spatial features selection might begin with an early, parallel detection of a 
      target object in the visual field, followed by the progressive focusing of 
      spatial attention onto the location of an actual target for its identification, 
      somehow in line with neural mechanisms reported in the literature as 
      "object-based space selection", or with those proposed for visual search.

TI  - Statistical feature extraction for artifact removal from concurrent fMRI-EEG 
      recordings.

AB  - We propose a set of algorithms for sequentially removing artifacts related to MRI 
      gradient switching and cardiac pulsations from electroencephalography (EEG) data 
      recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Special emphasis is 
      directed upon the use of statistical metrics and methods for the extraction and 
      selection of features that characterize gradient and pulse artifacts. To remove 
      gradient artifacts, we use channel-wise filtering based on singular value 
      decomposition (SVD). To remove pulse artifacts, we first decompose data into 
      temporally independent components and then select a compact cluster of components 
      that possess sustained high mutual information with the electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      After the removal of these components, the time courses of remaining components 
      are filtered by SVD to remove the temporal patterns phase-locked to the cardiac 
      timing markers derived from the ECG. The filtered component time courses are then 
      inversely transformed into multi-channel EEG time series free of pulse artifacts. 
      Evaluation based on a large set of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data obtained during a 
      variety of behavioral tasks, sensory stimulations and resting conditions showed 
      excellent data quality and robust performance attainable with the proposed 
      methods. These algorithms have been implemented as a Matlab-based toolbox made 
      freely available for public access and research use.

TI  - Examining cortical dynamics and connectivity with simultaneous single-pulse 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and fast optical imaging.
PG  - 2504-10
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.097 [doi]
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used experimental and 
      clinical technique that directly induces activity in human cortex using magnetic 
      fields. However, the neural mechanisms of TMS-induced activity are not well 
      understood. Here, we introduce a novel method of imaging TMS-evoked activity 
      using a non-invasive fast optical imaging tool, the event-related optical signal 
      (EROS). EROS measures changes in the scattering of near-infrared light that occur 
      synchronously with electrical activity in cortical tissue. EROS has good temporal 
      and spatial resolution, allowing the dynamics and spatial spread of a TMS pulse 
      to be measured. We used EROS to monitor activity induced in primary motor cortex 
      (M1) by a TMS pulse. Left- and right-hand representations were mapped using 
      standard TMS procedures. Optical sources and detectors mounted on thin rubber 
      patches were then centered on M1 hand representations. EROS was recorded 
      bilaterally from motor cortex while unilateral TMS was simultaneously delivered. 
      Robust ipsilateral EROS activations were apparent within 16 ms of a pulse for TMS 
      delivered to both left and right hemispheres. Clear motor evoked potentials 
      (MEPs) were also elicited by these TMS pulses. Movement artifacts could be 
      excluded as a source of EROS, as no activation was present on short-distance 
      optical channels. For left hemisphere TMS subsequent (40 ms) contralateral 
      activity was also present, presumably due to trans-synaptic propagation of 
      TMS-evoked activity. Results demonstrate that concurrent TMS/EROS is a viable and 
      potentially powerful method for studying TMS-induced activity in the human brain. 
      With further development, this technique may be applied more broadly in the study 
      of the dynamics of causal cortico-cortical connectivity.

AB  - Assistive devices for persons with limited motor control translate or amplify 
      remaining functions to allow otherwise impossible actions. These assistive 
      devices usually rely on just one type of input signal which can be derived from 
      residual muscle functions or any other kind of biosignal. When only one signal is 
      used, the functionality of the assistive device can be reduced as soon as the 
      quality of the provided signal is impaired. The quality can decrease in case of 
      fatigue, lack of concentration, high noise, spasms, tremors, depending on the 
      type of signal. To overcome this dependency on one input signal, a combination of 
      more inputs should be feasible. This work presents a hybrid Brain-Computer 
      Interface (hBCI) approach where two different input signals (joystick and BCI) 
      were monitored and only one of them was chosen as a control signal at a time. 
      Users could move a car in a game-like feedback application to collect coins and 
      avoid obstacles via either joystick or BCI control. Both control types were 
      constantly monitored with four different long term quality measures to evaluate 
      the current state of the signals. As soon as the quality dropped below a certain 
      threshold, a monitoring system would switch to the other control mode and vice 
      versa. Additionally, short term quality measures were applied to check for strong 
      artifacts that could render voluntary control impossible. These measures were 
      used to prohibit actions carried out during times when highly uncertain signals 
      were recorded. The switching possibility allowed more functionality for the 
      users. Moving the car was still possible even after one control mode was not 
      working any more. The proposed system serves as a basis that shows how BCI can be 
      used as an assistive device, especially in combination with other assistive 
      technology.

TI  - The saccadic spike artifact in MEG.
PG  - 1657-67
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.020 [doi]
AB  - Electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) are the means to investigate the 
      dynamics of neuronal activity non-invasively in the human brain. However, both 
      EEG and MEG are also sensitive to non-neural sources, which can severely 
      complicate the interpretation. The saccadic spike potential (SP) at saccade onset 
      has been identified as a particularly problematic artifact in EEG because it 
      closely resembles synchronous neuronal gamma band activity. While the SP and its 
      confounding effects on EEG have been thoroughly characterized, the corresponding 
      artifact in MEG, the saccadic spike field (SF), has not been investigated. Here 
      we provide a detailed characterization of the SF. We simultaneously recorded MEG, 
      EEG, gaze position and electrooculogram (EOG). We compared the SF in MEG for 
      different saccade sizes and directions and contrasted it with the well-known SP 
      in EEG. Our results reveal a saccade amplitude and direction dependent, 
      lateralized saccadic spike artifact, which was most prominent in the gamma 
      frequency range. The SF was strongest at frontal and temporal sensors but unlike 
      the SP in EEG did not contaminate parietal sensors. Furthermore, we observed that 
      the source configurations of the SF were comparable for regular and miniature 
      saccades. Using distributed source analysis we identified the sources of the SF 
      in the extraocular muscles. In summary, our results show that the SF in MEG 
      closely resembles neuronal activity in frontal and temporal sensors. Our detailed 
      characterization of the SF constitutes a solid basis for assessing possible 
      saccadic spike related contamination in MEG experiments.

TI  - Motion-related artefacts in EEG predict neuronally plausible patterns of 
      activation in fMRI data.
PG  - 261-70
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.094 [doi]
AB  - The simultaneous acquisition and subsequent analysis of EEG and fMRI data is 
      challenging owing to increased noise levels in the EEG data. A common method to 
      integrate data from these two modalities is to use aspects of the EEG data, such 
      as the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERP) or oscillatory EEG activity, 
      to predict fluctuations in the fMRI data. However, this relies on the acquisition 
      of high quality datasets to ensure that only the correlates of neuronal activity 
      are being studied. In this study, we investigate the effects of 
      head-motion-related artefacts in the EEG signal on the predicted T2*-weighted 
      signal variation. We apply our analyses to two independent datasets: 1) four 
      participants were asked to move their feet in the scanner to generate small head 
      movements, and 2) four participants performed an episodic memory task. We created 
      T2*-weighted signal predictors from indicators of abrupt head motion using 
      derivatives of the realignment parameters, from visually detected artefacts in 
      the EEG as well as from three EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha and beta). In 
      both datasets, we found little correlation between the T2*-weighted signal and 
      EEG predictors that were not convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response 
      function (cHRF). However, all convolved EEG predictors strongly correlated with 
      the T2*-weighted signal variation in various regions including the bilateral 
      superior temporal cortex, supplementary motor area, medial parietal cortex and 
      cerebellum. The finding that movement onset spikes in the EEG predict 
      T2*-weighted signal intensity only when the time course of movements is convolved 
      with the cHRF, suggests that the correlated signal might reflect a BOLD response 
      to neural activity associated with head movement. Furthermore, the observation 
      that broad-spectral EEG spikes tend to occur at the same time as abrupt head 
      movements, together with the finding that abrupt movements and EEG spikes show 
      similar correlations with the T2*-weighted signal, indicates that the EEG spikes 
      are produced by abrupt movement and that continuous regressors of EEG 
      oscillations contain motion-related noise even after stringent correction of the 
      EEG data. If not properly removed, these artefacts complicate the use of EEG data 
      as a predictor of T2*-weighted signal variation.

AB  - Mapping the dynamics of neural source processes critically involved in initiating 
      and propagating seizure activity is important for effective epilepsy diagnosis, 
      intervention, and treatment. Tracking time-varying shifts in the oscillation 
      modes of an evolving seizure may be useful for both seizure onset detection as 
      well as for improved non-surgical interventions such as microstimulation. In this 
      report we apply a multivariate eigendecomposition method to analyze the 
      time-varying principal oscillation patterns (POPs, or eigenmodes) of 
      maximally-independent (ICA) sources of intracranial EEG data recorded from

AB  - One of the inherent weaknesses of the EEG signal processing is noises and 
      artifacts. To overcome it, some methods for prediction of epilepsy recently 
      reported in the literature are based on the evaluation of chaotic behavior of 
      intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. These methods reduced 
      noises, but they were hazardous to patients. In this study, we propose using 
      Lyapunov spectrum to filter noise and detect epilepsy on scalp EEG signals only. 
      We determined that the Lyapunov spectrum can be considered as the most expected 
      method to evaluate chaotic behavior of scalp EEG recordings and to be robust 
      within noises. Obtained results are compared to the independent component 
      analysis (ICA) and largest Lyapunov exponent. The results of detecting epilepsy 
      are compared to diagnosis from medical doctors in case of typical general 
      epilepsy.

AB  - A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a hardware and software communications system 
      that permits cerebral activity alone to control computers or external devices. 
      The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to 
      severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological 
      neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem 
      stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, 
      looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, 
      preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the 
      control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, 
      and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to 
      design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities 
      used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different 
      functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. 
      Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that 
      determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the 
      review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with 
      the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the 
      review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and 
      classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into 
      commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally, the review provides an 
      overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices.

PG  - 144-50
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0b013e3182280353 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reduce stimulus transduction artifacts in EEG while using insert 
      earphones. DESIGN: Reference Equivalent Threshold SPLs were assessed for Etymotic 
      ER-4B earphones in 15 volunteers. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and middle 
      latency responses (MLRs)-as well as long-duration complex ABRs-to click and /dα/ 
      speech stimuli were recorded in a single-case design. RESULTS: Transduction 
      artifacts occurred in raw EEG responses, but they were eliminated by shielding, 
      counter-phasing (averaging across stimuli 180° out of phase), or rereferencing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical grade ABRs, MLRs, and cABRs can be recorded with a standard 
      digital EEG system and high-fidelity insert earphones, provided one or more 
      techniques are used to remove the stimulus transduction artifact.

TI  - An empirical investigation of motion effects in eMRI of interictal epileptiform 
      spikes.
PG  - 1401-9
LID - 10.1016/j.mri.2011.03.007 [doi]
AB  - We recently developed a functional neuroimaging technique called encephalographic 
      magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI). Our method acquires rapid single-shot 
      gradient-echo echo-planar MRI (repetition time=47 ms); it attempts to measure an 
      MR signal more directly linked to neuronal electromagnetic activity than existing 
      methods. To increase the likelihood of detecting such an MR signal, we recorded 
      concurrent MRI and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during fast (20-200 ms), 
      localized, high-amplitude (>50 μV on EEG) cortical discharges in a cohort of 
      focal epilepsy patients. Seen on EEG as interictal spikes, these discharges occur 
      in between seizures and induced easily detectable MR magnitude and phase changes 
      concurrent with the spikes with a lag of milliseconds to tens of milliseconds. 
      Due to the time scale of the responses, localized changes in blood flow or 
      hemoglobin oxygenation are unlikely to cause the MR signal changes that we 
      observed. While the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear, in this study, we 
      empirically investigate one potentially important confounding variable - motion. 
      Head motion in the scanner affects both EEG and MR recording. It can produce 
      brief "spike-like" artifacts on EEG and induce large MR signal changes similar to 
      our interictal spike-related signal changes. In order to explore the possibility 
      that interictal spikes were associated with head motions (although such an 
      association had never been reported), we had previously tracked head position in 
      epilepsy patients during interictal spikes and explicitly demonstrated a lack of 
      associated head motion. However, that study was performed outside the MR scanner, 
      and the root-mean-square error in the head position measurement was 0.7 mm. The 
      large inaccuracy in this measurement therefore did not definitively rule out 
      motion as a possible signal generator. In this study, we instructed healthy 
      subjects to make deliberate brief (<500 ms) head motions inside the MR scanner 
      and imaged these head motions with concurrent EEG and MRI. We compared these 
      artifactual MR and EEG data to genuine interictal spikes. While per-voxel MR and 
      per-electrode EEG time courses for the motion case can mimic the corresponding 
      time courses associated with a genuine interictal spike, head motion can be 
      unambiguously differentiated from interictal spikes via scalp EEG potential maps. 
      Motion induces widespread changes in scalp potential, whereas interictal spikes 
      are localized and have a regional fall-off in amplitude. These findings make bulk 
      head motion an unlikely generator of the large spike-related MR signal changes 
      that we had observed. Further work is required to precisely identify the 
      underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Functional connectivity in slow-wave sleep: identification of synchronous 
      cortical activity during wakefulness and sleep using time series analysis of 
      electroencephalographic data.
PG  - 496-505
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2011.00911.x [doi]
AB  - Sleep is a behavioral state ideal for studying functional connectivity because it 
      minimizes many sources of between-subject variability that confound waking 
      analyses. This is particularly important for potential connectivity studies in 
      mental illness where cognitive ability, internal milieu and active psychotic 
      symptoms can vary widely across subjects. We, therefore, sought to adapt 
      techniques applied to magnetoencephalography for use in high-density 
      electroencephalography (EEG), the gold-standard in brain-recording methods during 
      sleep. Autoregressive integrative moving average modeling was used to reduce 
      spurious correlations between recording sites (electrodes) in order to identify 
      functional networks. We hypothesized that identified network characteristics 
      would be similar to those found with magnetoencephalography, and would 
      demonstrate sleep stage-related differences in a control population. We analysed 
      60-s segments of low-artifact data from seven healthy human subjects during 
      wakefulness and sleep. EEG analysis of eyes-closed wakefulness revealed 
      widespread nearest-neighbor positive synchronous interactions, similar to 
      magnetoencephalography, though less consistent across subjects. Rapid eye 
      movement sleep demonstrated positive synchronous interactions akin to wakefulness 
      but weaker. Slow-wave sleep (SWS), instead, showed strong positive interactions 
      in a large left fronto-temporal-parietal cluster markedly more consistent across 
      subjects. Comparison of connectivity from early SWS to SWS from a later sleep 
      cycle indicated sleep-related reduction in connectivity in this region. The 
      consistency of functional connectivity during SWS within and across subjects 
      suggests this may be a promising technique for comparing functional connectivity 
      between mental illness and health.

TI  - Event-related potentials elicited by errors during the stop-signal task. I. 
      Macaque monkeys.

AB  - The error-related negativity (ERN) and positivity (Pe) are components of 
      event-related potential (ERP) waveforms recorded from humans and are thought to 
      reflect performance monitoring. Error-related signals have also been found in 
      single-neuron responses and local-field potentials recorded in supplementary eye 
      field and anterior cingulate cortex of macaque monkeys. However, the homology of 
      these neural signals across species remains controversial. Here, we show that 
      monkeys exhibit ERN and Pe components when they commit errors during a saccadic 
      stop-signal task. The voltage distributions and current densities of these 
      components were similar to those found in humans performing the same task. 
      Subsequent analyses show that neither stimulus- nor response-related artifacts 
      accounted for the error-ERPs. This demonstration of macaque homologues of the ERN 
      and Pe forms a keystone in the bridge linking human and nonhuman primate studies 
      on the neural basis of performance monitoring.

TI  - Removal of spurious coherence in MEG source-space coherence analysis.
PG  - 3121-9
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2011.2162514 [doi]
AB  - Source-space coherence analysis has become a popular method to estimate 
      functional connectivity based on MEG/EEG. Source-space analysis involves solving 
      the inverse problem, estimating the time courses of specific brain regions, and 
      then examining the coherence between activities at different brain regions. 
      However, source-space coherence analysis can be confounded by spurious coherence 
      caused due to the leakage properties of the inverse algorithm employed. Such 
      spurious coherence is typically manifested as an artifactual large peak around 
      the seed voxel, called seed blur, in the resulting coherence images. This seed 
      blur often obscures important details of brain interactions. This paper proposes 
      the use of the imaginary part of the coherence to remove the spurious coherence 
      caused by the leakage of an imaging algorithm. We present a theoretical analysis 
      that explains how the use of imaginary part can remove this spurious coherence. 
      We then present results from both computer simulations and experiments using 
      resting-state MEG data which demonstrate the validity of our analysis.

TI  - Occipital gamma-oscillations modulated during eye movement tasks: simultaneous 
      eye tracking and electrocorticography recording in epileptic patients.
PG  - 1101-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.043 [doi]
AB  - We determined the spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical gamma-oscillations 
      modulated during eye movement tasks, using simultaneous eye tracking and 
      intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recording. Patients with focal epilepsy 
      were instructed to follow a target moving intermittently and unpredictably from 
      one place to another either in an instantaneous or smooth fashion during 
      extraoperative ECoG recording. Target motion elicited augmentation of 
      gamma-oscillations in the lateral, inferior and polar occipital regions in 
      addition to portions of parietal and frontal regions; subsequent voluntary eye 
      movements elicited gamma-augmentation in the medial occipital region. Such 
      occipital gamma-augmentations could not be explained by contaminations of ocular 
      or myogenic artifacts. The degree of gamma-augmentation was generally larger 
      during saccade compared to pursuit trials, while a portion of the polar occipital 
      region showed pursuit-preferential gamma-augmentations. In addition to the 
      aforementioned eye movement task, patients were asked to read a single word 
      popping up on the screen. Gamma-augmentation was elicited in widespread occipital 
      regions following word presentation, while gamma-augmentation in the anterior 
      portion of the medial occipital region was elicited by an involuntary saccade 
      following word presentation rather than word presentation itself. 
      Gamma-augmentation in the lateral, inferior and polar occipital regions can be 
      explained by increased attention to a moving target, whereas gamma-augmentation 
      in the anterior-medial occipital region may be elicited by images in the 
      peripheral field realigned following saccades. In functional studies comparing 
      brain activation between two tasks, eye movement patterns during tasks may need 
      to be considered as confounding factors.

AB  - A new class of complex domain blind source extraction algorithms suitable for the 
      extraction of both circular and non-circular complex signals is proposed. This is 
      achieved through sequential extraction based on the degree of kurtosis and in the 
      presence of non-circular measurement noise. The existence and uniqueness analysis 
      of the solution is followed by a study of fast converging variants of the 
      algorithm. The performance is first assessed through simulations on well 
      understood benchmark signals, followed by a case study on real-time artifact 
      removal from EEG signals, verified using both qualitative and quantitative 
      metrics. The results illustrate the power of the proposed approach in real-time 
      blind extraction of general complex-valued sources.

TI  - Seizure prediction with spectral power of EEG using cost-sensitive support vector 
      machines.
PG  - 1761-70
LID - 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03138.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We propose a patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction using 
      multiple features of spectral power from electroencephalogram (EEG) and support 
      vector machine (SVM) classification. METHODS: The proposed patient-specific 
      algorithm consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, SVM classification, and 
      postprocessing. Preprocessing removes artifacts of intracranial EEG recordings 
      and they are further preprocessed in bipolar and/or time-differential methods. 
      Features of spectral power of raw, or bipolar and/or time-differential 
      intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in nine bands are extracted from a sliding 
      20-s-long and half-overlapped window. Nine bands are selected based on standard 
      EEG frequency bands, but the wide gamma bands are split into four. Cost-sensitive 
      SVMs are used for classification of preictal and interictal samples, and double 
      cross-validation is used to achieve in-sample optimization and out-of-sample 
      testing. We postprocess SVM classification outputs using the Kalman Filter and it 
      removes sporadic and isolated false alarms. The algorithm has been tested on iEEG 
      of 18 patients of 20 available in the Freiburg EEG database who had three or more 
      seizure events. To investigate the discriminability of the features between 
      preictal and interictal, we use the Kernel Fisher Discriminant analysis. KEY 
      FINDINGS: The proposed patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction has 
      achieved high sensitivity of 97.5% with total 80 seizure events and a low false 
      alarm rate of 0.27 per hour and total false prediction times of 13.0% over a 
      total of 433.2 interictal hours by bipolar preprocessing (92.5% sensitivity, a 
      false positive rate of 0.20 per hour, and false prediction times of 9.5% by 
      time-differential preprocessing). This high prediction rate demonstrates that 
      seizures can be predicted by the patient-specific approach using linear features 
      of spectral power and nonlinear classifiers. Bipolar and/or time-differential 
      preprocessing significantly improves sensitivity and specificity. Spectral powers 
      in high gamma bands are the most discriminating features between preictal and 
      interictal. SIGNIFICANCE: High sensitivity and specificity are achieved by 
      nonlinear classification of linear features of spectral power. Power changes in 
      certain frequency bands already demonstrated their possibilities for seizure 
      prediction indicators, but we have demonstrated that combining those spectral 
      power features and classifying them in a multivariate approach led to much higher 
      prediction rates. Employing only linear features is advantageous, especially when 
      it comes to an implantable device, because they can be computed rapidly with low 
      power consumption.

TI  - Real-time feature extraction of P300 component using adaptive nonlinear principal 
      component analysis.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-10-83 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are known to involve the 
      firings of neurons in the brain. The P300 wave is a high potential caused by an 
      event-related stimulus. The detection of P300s included in the measured EEG 
      signals is widely investigated. The difficulties in detecting them are that they 
      are mixed with other signals generated over a large brain area and their 
      amplitudes are very small due to the distance and resistivity differences in 
      their transmittance. METHODS: A novel real-time feature extraction method for 
      detecting P300 waves by combining an adaptive nonlinear principal component 
      analysis (ANPCA) and a multilayer neural network is proposed. The measured EEG 
      signals are first filtered using a sixth-order band-pass filter with cut-off 
      frequencies of 1 Hz and 12 Hz. The proposed ANPCA scheme consists of four steps: 
      pre-separation, whitening, separation, and estimation. In the experiment, four 
      different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) are utilized: 325 ms, 350 ms, 375 ms, 
      and 400 ms. RESULTS: The developed multi-stage principal component analysis 
      method applied at the pre-separation step has reduced the external noises and 
      artifacts significantly. The introduced adaptive law in the whitening step has 
      made the subsequent algorithm in the separation step to converge fast. The 
      separation performance index has varied from -20 dB to -33 dB due to randomness 
      of source signals. The robustness of the ANPCA against background noises has been 
      evaluated by comparing the separation performance indices of the ANPCA with four 
      algorithms (NPCA, NSS-JD, JADE, and SOBI), in which the ANPCA algorithm 
      demonstrated the shortest iteration time with performance index about 0.03. Upon 
      this, it is asserted that the ANPCA algorithm successfully separates mixed source 
      signals. CONCLUSIONS: The independent components produced from the observed data 
      using the proposed method illustrated that the extracted signals were clearly the 
      P300 components elicited by task-related stimuli. The experiment using 350 ms ISI 
      showed the best performance. Since the proposed method does not use down-sampling 
      and averaging, it can be used as a viable tool for real-time clinical 
      applications.

AB  - Speech production long avoided electrophysiological experiments due to the 
      suspicion that potential artifacts caused by muscle activity of overt speech may 
      lead to a bad signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements. Therefore, researchers 
      have sought to assess speech production by using indirect speech production 
      tasks, such as tacit or implicit naming, delayed naming, or meta-linguistic 
      tasks, such as phoneme-monitoring. Covert speech may, however, involve different 
      processes than overt speech production. Recently, overt speech has been 
      investigated using electroencephalography (EEG). As the number of papers 
      published is rising steadily, this clearly indicates the increasing interest and 
      demand for overt speech research within the field of cognitive neuroscience of 
      language. Our main goal here is to review all currently available results of 
      overt speech production involving EEG measurements, such as picture naming, 
      Stroop naming, and reading aloud. We conclude that overt speech production can be 
      successfully studied using electrophysiological measures, for instance, 
      event-related brain potentials (ERPs). We will discuss possible relevant 
      components in the ERP waveform of speech production and aim to address the issue 
      of how to interpret the results of ERP research using overt speech, and whether 
      the ERP components in language production are comparable to results from other 
      fields.

TI  - Automatic classification of artifactual ICA-components for artifact removal in 
      EEG signals.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/1744-9081-7-30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both, the visual 
      interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis 
      (e.g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) or for Mental State Monitoring). While 
      hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component 
      Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit 
      from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based 
      removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or 
      have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. METHODS: We propose an 
      automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. 
      They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into 
      account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined 
      by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from 
      the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent 
      classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) 
      that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 
      1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on 
      new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 
      18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel 
      setups and from new subjects. RESULTS: Based on six features only, the optimized 
      linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement (<10% 
      Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the 
      same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15% MSE. On data of 
      the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used 
      for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60% of the most artifactual source 
      components. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA 
      components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based 
      on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and 
      supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data 
      sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye- and muscle artifacts. Its 
      performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG 
      studies.

TI  - EEG spectral coherence data distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome patients from 
      healthy controls and depressed patients--a case control study.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-11-82 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest central nervous system involvement in 
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), yet there are no established diagnostic criteria. 
      CFS may be difficult to differentiate from clinical depression. The study's 
      objective was to determine if spectral coherence, a computational derivative of 
      spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), could distinguish patients 
      with CFS from healthy control subjects and not erroneously classify depressed 
      patients as having CFS. METHODS: This is a study, conducted in an academic 
      medical center electroencephalography laboratory, of 632 subjects: 390 healthy 
      normal controls, 70 patients with carefully defined CFS, 24 with major 
      depression, and 148 with general fatigue. Aside from fatigue, all patients were 
      medically healthy by history and examination. EEGs were obtained and spectral 
      coherences calculated after extensive artifact removal. Principal Components 
      Analysis identified coherence factors and corresponding factor loading patterns. 
      Discriminant analysis determined whether spectral coherence factors could 
      reliably discriminate CFS patients from healthy control subjects without 
      misclassifying depression as CFS. RESULTS: Analysis of EEG coherence data from a 
      large sample (n = 632) of patients and healthy controls identified 40 factors 
      explaining 55.6% total variance. Factors showed highly significant group 
      differentiation (p < .0004) identifying 89.5% of unmedicated female CFS patients 
      and 92.4% of healthy female controls. Recursive jackknifing showed predictions 
      were stable. A conservative 10-factor discriminant function model was 
      subsequently applied, and also showed highly significant group discrimination (p 
      < .001), accurately classifying 88.9% unmedicated males with CFS, and 82.4% 
      unmedicated male healthy controls. No patient with depression was classified as 
      having CFS. The model was less accurate (73.9%) in identifying CFS patients 
      taking psychoactive medications. Factors involving the temporal lobes were of 
      primary importance. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral coherence analysis identified 
      unmedicated patients with CFS and healthy control subjects without misclassifying 
      depressed patients as CFS, providing evidence that CFS patients demonstrate brain 
      physiology that is not observed in healthy normals or patients with major 
      depression. Studies of new CFS patients and comparison groups are required to 
      determine the possible clinical utility of this test. The results concur with 
      other studies finding neurological abnormalities in CFS, and implicate temporal 
      lobe involvement in CFS pathophysiology.

TI  - Investigating social cognition in infants and adults using dense array 
      electroencephalography ((d)EEG).
LID - 2759 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/2759 [doi]
AB  - Dense array electroencephalography ((d)EEG), which provides a non-invasive window 
      for measuring brain activity and a temporal resolution unsurpassed by any other 
      current brain imaging technology¹, ² is being used increasingly in the study of 
      social cognitive functioning in infants and adults. While (d)EEG is enabling 
      researchers to examine brain activity patterns with unprecedented levels of 
      sensitivity, conventional EEG recording systems continue to face certain 
      limitations, including 1) poor spatial resolution and source localization³,⁴2) 
      the physical discomfort for test subjects of enduring the individual application 
      of numerous electrodes to the surface of the scalp, and 3) the complexity for 
      researchers of learning to use multiple software packages to collect and process 
      data. Here we present an overview of an established methodology that represents a 
      significant improvement on conventional methodologies for studying EEG in infants 
      and adults. Although several analytical software techniques can be used to 
      establish indirect indices of source localization to improve the spatial 
      resolution of (d)EEG, the HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) by Electrical 
      Geodesics, Inc. (EGI), a dense sensory array that maintains equal distances among 
      adjacent recording electrodes on all surfaces of the scalp, further enhances 
      spatial resolution⁴,⁵(,)⁶ compared to standard (d)EEG systems. The sponge-based 
      HCGSN can be applied rapidly and without scalp abrasion, making it ideal for use 
      with adults⁷,⁸ children⁹,¹⁰, ¹¹,¹² and infants¹², in both research and clinical 
      ⁴,⁵,⁶,¹³,¹⁴,¹⁵settings. This feature allows for considerable cost and time 
      savings by decreasing the average net application time compared to other (d)EEG 
      systems. Moreover, the HCGSN includes unified, seamless software applications for 
      all phases of data, greatly simplifying the collection, processing, and analysis 
      of (d)EEG data. The HCGSN features a low-profile electrode pedestal, which, when 
      filled with electrolyte solution, creates a sealed microenvironment and an 
      electrode-scalp interface. In all Geodesic (d;)EEG systems, EEG sensors detect 
      changes in voltage originating from the participant's scalp, along with a small 
      amount of electrical noise originating from the room environment. Electrical 
      signals from all sensors of the Geodesic sensor net are received simultaneously 
      by the amplifier, where they are automatically processed, packaged, and sent to 
      the data-acquisition computer (DAC). Once received by the DAC, scalp electrical 
      activity can be isolated from artifacts for analysis using the filtering and 
      artifact detection tools included in the EGI software. Typically, the HCGSN can 
      be used continuously for only up to two hours because the electrolyte solution 
      dries out over time, gradually decreasing the quality of the scalp-electrode 
      interface. In the Parent-Infant Research Lab at the University of Toronto, we are 
      using (d)EEG to study social cognitive processes including memory, emotion, 
      goals, intentionality, anticipation, and executive functioning in both adult and 
      infant participants.

PG  - 170-7
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31821213bd [doi]
AB  - Blind source separation (BSS) is a promising method for extracting 
      somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP). Although various BSS algorithms are 
      available for SEP extraction, few studies have addressed the performance 
      differences between them. In this study, we compared the performance of a number 
      of typical BSS algorithms on SEP extraction from both computer simulations and 
      clinical experiment. The algorithms we compared included second-order blind 
      identification, estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariance 
      technique, algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction, joint approximate 
      diagonalization of eigenmatrices, extended infomax, and fast independent 
      component analysis. The performances of these BSS algorithms were determined by 
      the correlation coefficients between the true and the extracted SEP signals. 
      There were significant differences in the performances of the various BSS 
      algorithms in a simulation study. In summary, second-order blind identification 
      using six covariance matrix denoting SOBI6 was recommended as the most 
      appropriate BSS method for fast SEP extraction from noisy backgrounds.

PG  - 51
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00051 [doi]
LID - 51
AB  - Intra-participant variability in clinical conditions such as autistic spectrum 
      disorder (ASD) is an important indicator of pathophysiological processing. The 
      data reported here illustrate that trial-by-trial variability can be reliably 
      measured from EEG, and that intra-participant EEG variability is significantly 
      greater in those with ASD than in neuro-typical matched controls. EEG recorded at 
      the scalp is a linear mixture of activity arising from muscle artifacts and 
      numerous concurrent brain processes. To minimize these additional sources of 
      variability, EEG data were subjected to two different methods of spatial 
      filtering. (i) The data were decomposed using infomax independent component 
      analysis, a method of blind source separation which un-mixes the EEG signal into 
      components with maximally independent time-courses, and (ii) a surface Laplacian 
      transform was performed (current source density interpolation) in order to reduce 
      the effects of volume conduction. Data are presented from 13 high functioning 
      adolescents with ASD without co-morbid ADHD, and 12 neuro-typical age-, IQ-, and 
      gender-matched controls. Comparison of variability between the ASD and 
      neuro-typical groups indicated that intra-participant variability of P1 latency 
      and P1 amplitude was greater in the participants with ASD, and inter-trial α-band 
      phase coherence was lower in the participants with ASD. These data support the 
      suggestion that individuals with ASD are less able to synchronize the activity of 
      stimulus-related cell assemblies than neuro-typical individuals, and provide 
      empirical evidence in support of theories of increased neural noise in ASD.

TI  - Propofol withdrawal seizures: non-epileptic nature of seizures in a patient with 
      recently controlled status epilepticus.
PG  - 107-10
LID - 10.1684/epd.2011.0404 [doi]
AB  - Seizures or seizure-like phenomena which are mostly convulsive have been observed 
      during the induction, maintenance and withdrawal phases of propofol 
      administration. The nature and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well 
      understood and several case reports on these phenomena have presented only 
      indirect evidence. We report on a patient who was administered propofol in order 
      to control status epilepticus with success. However, every attempt at propofol 
      withdrawal was followed by convulsive seizure-like activity. Continuous EEG 
      monitoring showed muscle artefacts without any ictal discharges. Based on this 
      finding, the propofol treatment was withdrawn and the seizure-like activity 
      eventually attenuated and resolved. We propose that seizure-like phenomena 
      associated with propofol withdrawal may not be ictal in nature and should not 
      lead to unnecessary resumption of propofol infusion without documentation of an 
      epileptic origin by EEG.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study presents a multi-channel patient-independent neonatal 
      seizure detection system based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. 
      METHODS: A machine learning algorithm (SVM) is used as a classifier to 
      discriminate between seizure and non-seizure EEG epochs. Two post-processing 
      steps are proposed to increase both the temporal precision and the robustness of 
      the system. The resulting system is validated on a large clinical dataset of 267 
      h of EEG data from 17 full-term newborns with seizures. RESULTS: The performance 
      of the system using event-based metrics is reported. The system showed the best 
      up-to-date performance of a neonatal seizure detection system. The system was 
      able to achieve an average good detection rate of ~89% with one false seizure 
      detection per hour, ~96% with two false detections per hour, or ~100% with four 
      false detections per hour. An analysis of errors revealed sources of 
      misclassification in terms of both missed seizures and false detections. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained with the proposed SVM-based seizure detection 
      system allow for its practical application in neonatal intensive care units. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed SVM-based seizure detection system can greatly assist 
      clinical staff, in a neonatal intensive care unit, to interpret the EEG. The 
      system allows control of the final decision by choosing different confidence 
      levels which makes it flexible for clinical needs. The obtained results may 
      provide a reference for future seizure detection systems.

TI  - Reducing the gradient artefact in simultaneous EEG-fMRI by adjusting the 
      subject's axial position.
PG  - 1942-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.079 [doi]
AB  - Large artefacts that compromise EEG data quality are generated when 
      electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are 
      carried out concurrently. The gradient artefact produced by the time-varying 
      magnetic field gradients is the largest of these artefacts. Although average 
      artefact correction (AAS) and related techniques can remove the majority of this 
      artefact, the need to avoid amplifier saturation necessitates the use of a large 
      dynamic range and strong low-pass filtering in EEG recording. Any intrinsic 
      reduction in the gradient artefact amplitude would allow data with a higher 
      bandwidth to be acquired without amplifier saturation, thus increasing the 
      frequency range of neuronal activity that can be investigated using combined 
      EEG-fMRI. Furthermore, gradient artefact correction methods assume a constant 
      artefact morphology over time, so their performance is compromised by subject 
      movement. Since the resulting, residual gradient artefacts can easily swamp 
      signals from brain activity, any reduction in their amplitude would be highly 
      advantageous for simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies. The aim of this work was to 
      investigate whether adjustment of the subject's axial position in the MRI scanner 
      can reduce the amplitude of the induced gradient artefact, before and after 
      artefact correction using AAS. The variation in gradient artefact amplitude as a 
      function of the subject's axial position was first investigated in six subjects 
      by applying gradient pulses along the three Cartesian axes. The results of this 
      study showed that a significant reduction in the gradient artefact magnitude can 
      be achieved by shifting the subject axially by 4 cm towards the feet relative to 
      the standard subject position (nasion at iso-centre). In a further study, the 
      4-cm shift was shown to produce a 40% reduction in the RMS amplitude (and a 31% 
      reduction in the range) of the gradient artefact generated during the execution 
      of a standard multi-slice, EPI sequence. By picking out signals occurring at 
      harmonics of the slice acquisition frequency, it was also shown that the 4-cm 
      shift led to a 36% reduction in the residual gradient artefact after AAS. 
      Functional and anatomical MR data quality is not affected by the 4-cm shift, as 
      the head remains in the homogeneous region of the static magnet field and 
      gradients.

TI  - Trial-to-trial noise cancellation of cortical field potentials in awake macaques 
      by autoregression model with exogenous input (ARX).
PG  - 266-73
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2010.10.029 [doi]
AB  - Gamma band synchronization has drawn increasing interest with respect to its 
      potential role in neuronal encoding strategy and behavior in awake, behaving 
      animals. However, contamination of these recordings by power line noise can 
      confound the analysis and interpretation of cortical local field potential (LFP). 
      Existing denoising methods are plagued by inadequate noise reduction, 
      inaccuracies, and even introduction of new noise components. To carefully and 
      more completely remove such contamination, we propose an automatic method based 
      on the concept of adaptive noise cancellation that utilizes the correlative 
      features of common noise sources, and implement with AutoRegressive model with 
      eXogenous Input (ARX). We apply this technique to both simulated data and LFPs 
      recorded in the primary visual cortex of awake macaque monkeys. The analyses here 
      demonstrate a greater degree of accurate noise removal than conventional notch 
      filters. Our method leaves desired signal intact and does not introduce 
      artificial noise components. Application of this method to awake monkey V1 
      recordings reveals a significant power increase in the gamma range evoked by 
      visual stimulation. Our findings suggest that the ARX denoising procedure will be 
      an important pre-processing step in the analysis of large volumes of cortical LFP 
      data as well as high frequency (gamma-band related) 
      electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) applications, one which 
      will help to convincingly dissociate this notorious artifact from gamma-band 
      activity.

AB  - A novel cable-driven robotic gait training system has been tested to improve the 
      locomotor function in individuals post stroke. Seven subjects with chronic stroke 
      were recruited to participate in this 6 weeks robot-assisted treadmill training 
      paradigm. A controlled assistance force was applied to the paretic leg at the 
      ankle through a cable-driven robotic system. The force was applied from late 
      stance to mid-swing during treadmill training. Body weight support was provided 
      as necessary to prevent knee buckling or toe drag. Subjects were trained 3 times 
      a week for 6 weeks. Overground gait speed, 6 minute walking distance, and balance 
      were evaluated at pre, post 6 weeks robotic training, and at 8 weeks follow up. 
      Significant improvements in gait speed and 6 minute walking distance were 
      obtained following robotic treadmill training through a cable-driven robotic 
      system. Results from this study indicate that it is feasible to improve the 
      locomotor function in individuals post stroke through a flexible cable-driven 
      robot.

LID - 598206
AB  - We started writing the "fMRI artefact rejection and sleep scoring toolbox", or 
      "FAST", to process our sleep EEG-fMRI data, that is, the simultaneous recording 
      of electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging data 
      acquired while a subject is asleep. FAST tackles three crucial issues typical of 
      this kind of data: (1) data manipulation (viewing, comparing, chunking, etc.) of 
      long continuous M/EEG recordings, (2) rejection of the fMRI-induced artefact in 
      the EEG signal, and (3) manual sleep-scoring of the M/EEG recording. Currently, 
      the toolbox can efficiently deal with these issues via a GUI, SPM8 batching 
      system or hand-written script. The tools developed are, of course, also useful 
      for other EEG applications, for example, involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      acquisition, continuous EEG eye-balling, and manipulation. Even though the 
      toolbox was originally devised for EEG data, it will also gracefully handle MEG 
      data without any problem. "FAST" is developed in Matlab as an add-on toolbox for 
      SPM8 and, therefore, internally uses its SPM8-meeg data format. "FAST" is 
      available for free, under the

TI  - Explaining Entropy responses after a noxious stimulus, with or without 
      neuromuscular blocking agents, by means of the raw electroencephalographic and 
      electromyographic characteristics.
PG  - 69-76
LID - 10.1093/bja/aeq300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Entropy™, an anaesthetic EEG monitoring method, yields two 
      parameters: State Entropy (SE) and Response Entropy (RE). SE reflects the 
      hypnotic level of the patient. RE covers also the EMG-dominant part of the 
      frequency spectrum, reflecting the upper facial EMG response to noxious 
      stimulation. We studied the EEG, EMG, and Entropy values before and after skin 
      incision, and the effect of rocuronium on Entropy and EMG at skin incision during 
      sevoflurane-nitrous oxide (N₂O) anaesthesia. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients were 
      anaesthetized with sevoflurane-N₂O or sevoflurane-N₂O-rocuronium. The biosignal 
      was stored and analysed off-line to detect EEG patterns, EMG, and artifacts. The 
      signal, its power spectrum, SE, RE, and RE-SE values were analysed before and 
      after skin incision. The EEG arousal was classified as β (increase in over 8 Hz 
      activity and decrease in under 4 Hz activity with a typical β pattern) or δ 
      (increase in under 4 Hz activity with the characteristic rhythmic δ pattern and a 
      decrease in over 8 Hz activity). RESULTS: The EEG arousal appeared in 17 of 19 
      and 15 of 19 patients (NS), and the EMG arousal in 0 of 19 and 13 of 19 patients 
      (P<0.01) with and without rocuronium, respectively. Both β (n=30) and EMG 
      arousals increased SE and RE. The δ arousal (n=2) decreased both SE and RE. A 
      significant increase in RE-SE values was only seen in patients without 
      rocuronium. CONCLUSIONS: During sevoflurane-N₂O anaesthesia, both EEG and EMG 
      arousals were seen. β and δ arousals had opposite effects on the Entropy values. 
      The EMG arousal was abolished by rocuronium at the train of four level 0/4.

TI  - Electromyogenic Artifacts and Electroencephalographic Inferences Revisited.
PG  - 4-9
AB  - Recent years have witnessed a renewed interest in using oscillatory brain 
      electrical activity to understand the neural bases of cognition and emotion. 
      Electrical signals originating from pericranial muscles represent a profound 
      threat to the validity of such research. Recently, McMenamin et al (2010) 
      examined whether independent component analysis (ICA) provides a sensitive and 
      specific means of correcting electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts. This report sparked 
      the accompanying commentary (Olbrich, Jödicke, Sander, Himmerich & Hegerl, in 
      press), and here we revisit the question of how EMG can alter inferences drawn 
      from the EEG and what can be done to minimize its pernicious effects. 
      Accordingly, we briefly summarize salient features of the EMG problem and review 
      recent research investigating the utility of ICA for correcting EMG and other 
      artifacts. We then directly address the key concerns articulated by Olbrich and 
      provide a critique of their efforts at validating ICA. We conclude by identifying 
      key areas for future methodological work and offer some practical recommendations 
      for intelligently addressing EMG artifact.

TI  - Peak and averaged bicoherence for different EEG patterns during general 
      anaesthesia.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-9-76 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in nonlinear neuronal mechanisms of EEG generation in the 
      course of general anaesthesia have been extensively investigated in research 
      literature. A number of EEG signal properties capable of tracking these changes 
      have been reported and employed in anaesthetic depth monitors. The degree of 
      phase coupling between different spectral components is a marker of nonlinear EEG 
      generators and is claimed to be an important aspect of BIS. While bicoherence is 
      the most direct measure of phase coupling, according to published research it is 
      not directly used in the calculation of BIS, and only limited studies of its 
      association with anaesthetic depth and level of consciousness have been 
      published. This paper investigates bicoherence parameters across equal band and 
      unequal band bifrequency regions, during different states of anaesthetic depth 
      relating to routine clinical anaesthesia, as determined by visual inspection of 
      EEG. METHODS: 41 subjects scheduled for day surgery under general anaesthesia 
      were recruited into this study. EEG bicoherence was analysed using average and 
      smoothed-peak estimates calculated over different regions on the bifrequency 
      plane. Statistical analysis of associations between anaesthetic depth/state of 
      consciousness and bicoherence estimates included linear regression using 
      generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMs), ROC curves and prediction 
      probability (Pk). RESULTS: Bicoherence estimates for the δ_θ region on the 
      bifrequency plane were more sensitive to anaesthetic depth changes compared to 
      other bifrequency regions. Smoothed-peak bicoherence displayed stronger 
      associations than average bicoherence. Excluding burst suppression and large 
      transients, the δ_θ peak bicoherence was significantly associated with level of 
      anaesthetic depth (z = 25.74, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.191). Estimates of Pk for this 
      parameter were 0.889(0.867-0.911) and 0.709(0.689-0.729) respectively for 
      conscious states and anaesthetic depth levels (comparable BIS estimates were 
      0.928(0.905-0.950) and 0.801(0.786-0.816)). Estimates of linear regression and 
      areas under ROC curves supported Pk findings. Bicoherence for eye movement 
      artifacts were the most distinctive with respect to other EEG patterns (average 
      |z| value 13.233). CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified associations between 
      deepening anaesthesia and increase in bicoherence for different frequency 
      components and bicoherence estimates. Increase in bicoherence was also 
      established for eye movement artifacts. While identified associations extend 
      earlier findings of bicoherence changes with increases in anaesthetic drug 
      concentration, results indicate that the unequal band bifrequency region, δ_θ, 
      provides better predictive capabilities than equal band bifrequency regions.

TI  - "Seeing" electroencephalogram through the skull: imaging prefrontal cortex with 
      fast optical signal.
PG  - 061702
LID - 10.1117/1.3505007 [doi]
LID - 061702
AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy is a novel imaging technique potentially sensitive to 
      both brain hemodynamics (slow signal) and neuronal activity (fast optical signal, 
      FOS). The big challenge of measuring FOS noninvasively lies in the presumably low 
      signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, detectability of the FOS has been controversially 
      discussed. We present reliable detection of FOS from 11 individuals concurrently 
      with electroencephalogram (EEG) during a Go-NoGo task. Probes were placed 
      bilaterally over prefrontal cortex. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used 
      for artifact removal. Correlation coefficient in the best correlated FOS-EEG ICA 
      pairs was highly significant (p < 10(-8)), and event-related optical signal 
      (EROS) was found in all subjects. Several EROS components were similar to the 
      event-related potential (ERP) components. The most robust "optical N200" at t = 
      225 ms coincided with the N200 ERP; both signals showed significant difference 
      between targets and nontargets, and their timing correlated with subject's 
      reaction time. Correlation between FOS and EEG even in single trials provides 
      further evidence that at least some FOS components "reflect" electrical brain 
      processes directly. The data provide evidence for the early involvement of 
      prefrontal cortex in rapid object recognition. EROS is highly localized and can 
      provide cost-effective imaging tools for cortical mapping of cognitive processes.

TI  - SIGNAL REGULARITY-BASED AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR SCALP EEG 
      MONITORING.
PG  - 922-935
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to build a clinically useful automated 
      seizure detection system for scalp EEG recordings. To achieve this, a computer 
      algorithm was designed to translate complex multichannel scalp EEG signals into 
      several dynamical descriptors, followed by the investigations of their 
      spatiotemporal properties that relate to the ictal (seizure) EEG patterns as well 
      as to normal physiologic and artifact signals. This paper describes in detail 
      this novel seizure detection algorithm and reports its performance in a large 
      clinical dataset.

TI  - Feasibility of online seizure detection with continuous EEG monitoring in the 
      intensive care unit.
PG  - 580-6
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2010.09.007 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Continuous EEG (cEEG) is of great interest in view of the reported 
      high prevalence of non-convulsive seizures on intensive care units (ICUs). Here, 
      we describe our experiences applying a seizure warning system using cEEG 
      monitoring. METHODS: Fifty comatose ICU patients were included prospectively and 
      monitored. Twenty-eight patients had post-anoxic encephalopathy (PAE) and 22 had 
      focal brain lesions. A measure of neuronal interactions, synchronization 
      likelihood, was calculated online over 10s EEG epochs and instances when the 
      synchronization likelihood exceeded a threshold where marked as seizures. 
      RESULTS: Five patients developed seizures. Our method detected seizures in three 
      patients, in the other patients seizures were missed because of they were 
      non-convulsive and had a focal character. The average false positive rate was 
      0.676/h. DISCUSSION: This is our first attempt to implement online seizure 
      detection in the ICU. Despite problems with artifacts and that we missed focally 
      oriented seizures, we succeeded in monitoring patients online. Given the 
      relatively high occurrence of seizures, online seizure detection with cEEG merits 
      further development for use in ICUs.

TI  - Unsupervised classification of high-frequency oscillations in human neocortical 
      epilepsy and control patients.
PG  - 2900-12

AB  - High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been observed in animal and human 
      intracranial recordings during both normal and aberrant brain states. It has been 
      proposed that the relationship between subclasses of these oscillations can be 
      used to identify epileptic brain. Studies of HFOs in epilepsy have been hampered 
      by selection bias arising primarily out of the need to reduce the volume of data 
      so that clinicians can manually review it. In this study, we introduce an 
      algorithm for detecting and classifying these signals automatically and 
      demonstrate the tractability of analyzing a data set of unprecedented size, over 
      31,000 channel-hours of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings 
      from micro- and macroelectrodes in humans. Using an unsupervised approach that 
      does not presuppose a specific number of clusters in the data, we show direct 
      evidence for the existence of distinct classes of transient oscillations within 
      the 100- to 500-Hz frequency range in a population of nine neocortical epilepsy 
      patients and two controls. The number of classes we find, four (three plus one 
      putative artifact class), is consistent with prior studies that identify "ripple" 
      and "fast ripple" oscillations using human-intensive methods and, additionally, 
      identifies a less examined class of mixed-frequency events.

AB  - To better characterize neurophysiologic processes underlying olfactory 
      dysfunction in schizophrenia, nose-referenced 30-channel electroencephalogram was 
      recorded from 32 patients and 35 healthy adults (18 and 18 male) during detection 
      of hydrogen sulfide (constant-flow olfactometer, 200 ms unirhinal exposure). 
      Event-related potentials (ERPs) were transformed to reference-free current source 
      density (CSD) waveforms and analyzed by unrestricted Varimax-PCA. Participants 
      indicated when they perceived a high (10 ppm) or low (50% dilution) odor 
      concentration. Patients and controls did not differ in detection of high (23% 
      misses) and low (43%) intensities and also had similar olfactory ERP waveforms. 
      CSDs showed a greater bilateral frontotemporal N1 sink (305 ms) and mid-parietal 
      P2 source (630 ms) for high than low intensities. N1 sink and P2 source were 
      markedly reduced in patients for high intensity stimuli, providing further 
      neurophysiological evidence of olfactory dysfunction in schizophrenia.

TI  - Value of 3.0 T MR imaging in refractory partial epilepsy and negative 1.5 T MRI.
PG  - 475-8
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2010.07.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-field 3.0 T MR scanners provide an improved signal-to-noise 
      ratio which can be translated in higher image resolution, possibly allowing 
      critical detection of subtle epileptogenic lesions missed on standard-field 
      1.0-1.5 T MRIs. In this study, the authors explore the potential value of 
      re-imaging at 3.0 T patients with refractory partial epilepsy and negative 1.5 T 
      MRI. METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with refractory partial 
      epilepsy candidate for surgery who had undergone a 3.0 T MR study after a 
      negative 1.5 T MR study. High-field 3.0 T MRIs were reviewed qualitatively by 
      neuroradiologists experienced in interpreting epilepsy studies with access to 
      clinical information. Relevance and impact on clinical management were assessed 
      by an epileptologist. RESULTS: Between November 2006 and August 2009, 36 patients 
      with refractory partial epilepsy candidate for surgery underwent 3.0 T MR study 
      after a 1.5 T MR study failed to disclose a relevant epileptogenic lesion. A 
      potential lesion was found only in two patients (5.6%, 95% CI: 1.5-18.1%). Both 
      were found to have hippocampal atrophy congruent with other presurgical 
      localization techniques which resulted in omission of an invasive EEG study and 
      direct passage to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of detection of a new 
      lesion by re-imaging at 3.0 T patients with refractory partial epilepsy candidate 
      for surgery was found to be low, but seems to offer the potential of a 
      significant clinical impact for selected patients. This finding needs to be 
      validated in a prospective controlled study.

PG  - 888-904

AB  - To determine whether data quality is meaningfully reduced by high electrode 
      impedance, EEG was recorded simultaneously from low- and high-impedance electrode 
      sites during an oddball task. Low-frequency noise was found to be increased at 
      high-impedance sites relative to low-impedance sites, especially when the 
      recording environment was warm and humid. The increased noise at the 
      high-impedance sites caused an increase in the number of trials needed to obtain 
      statistical significance in analyses of P3 amplitude, but this could be partially 
      mitigated by high-pass filtering and artifact rejection. High electrode impedance 
      did not reduce statistical power for the N1 wave unless the recording environment 
      was warm and humid. Thus, high electrode impedance may increase noise and 
      decrease statistical power under some conditions, but these effects can be 
      reduced by using a cool and dry recording environment and appropriate signal 
      processing methods.

TI  - A descriptive analysis of neck myoclonus during routine polysomnography.
PG  - 1091-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although episodes of neck myoclonus (head jerks) in REM sleep 
      have a characteristic appearance, they have so far not been described 
      systematically in video-polysomnography. This study assesses the occurrence, 
      frequency, and characteristics of neck myoclonus in REM sleep in a prospective 
      sleep disorder cohort, and investigates clinical correlates and associations with 
      medication. SETTING: University hospital sleep disorders center. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Two-hundred twenty-eight mixed sleep disorder patients. INTERVENTIONS: Not 
      applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: REM sleep was screened visually for short 
      "stripe-shaped" movement-induced artifacts visible vertically over the EEG leads 
      in polysomnographic registration. If such artifact was present, the synchronized 
      video was inspected for the presence of neck myoclonus. Out of 205 patients, 
      54.6% (n = 112) had neck myoclonus during REM sleep. The mean neck myoclonus 
      index was 1.0 +/- 2.7/h REM sleep. Younger patients had a higher neck myoclonus 
      index than older patients (< 45 years versus 45-60 years versus > 60 years: 1.8 
      +/- 4.2 versus 0.6 +/- 1.1 versus 0.5 +/- 1.1; P = 0.004). Ninety-five percent of 
      subjects < 45 years had a neck myoclonus index between 0 and 9.4/h; 95% of 
      subjects > 45 years had a neck myoclonus index between 0 and 2.7/h. Patients on 
      benzodiazepine treatment had no neck myoclonus (0/112 vs. 13/93; P < 0.001). In 
      23 patients, additional surface neck EMG was performed. EMG activation associated 
      with neck myoclonus had a mean duration of 0.6 +/- 0.4 sec. Correlation between 
      duration of neck EMG activation and movement-induced EEG artifact duration was 
      very high (rho = 0.96; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neck myoclonus is common during 
      REM sleep and more frequent in younger individuals. This could indicate that neck 
      myoclonus during REM sleep is a physiological phenomenon. If there is a cut-off 
      distinguishing normal from excessive has to be investigated in further studies.

AB  - Perceiving another individual's actions activates the human motor system. We 
      investigated whether this effect is stronger when the observed action is relevant 
      to the observer's task. The mu rhythm (oscillatory activity in the 8- to 13-Hz 
      band over sensorimotor cortex) was measured while participants watched videos of 
      grasping movements. In one of two conditions, the participants had to later 
      report how many times they had seen a certain kind of grasp. In the other 
      condition, they viewed the identical videos but had to later report how many 
      times they had seen a certain colour change. The colour change and the grasp 
      always occurred simultaneously. Results show mu rhythm attenuation when watching 
      the videos relative to baseline. This attenuation was stronger when participants 
      later reported the grasp rather than the colour, suggesting that the motor system 
      is more strongly activated when the observed grasping actions were relevant to 
      the observer's task. Moreover, when the graspable object disappeared after the 
      offset of the video, there was subsequent mu rhythm enhancement, reflecting a 
      post-stimulus inhibitory rebound. This enhancement was again stronger when making 
      judgments about the grasp than the colour, suggesting that the stronger 
      activation is followed by a stronger inhibitory rebound.

TI  - Cortical and subcortical contributions to absence seizure onset examined with 
      EEG/fMRI.
PG  - 404-13
LID - 10.1016/j.yebeh.2010.05.009 [doi]
AB  - In patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), bursts of generalized 
      spike and wave discharges (GSWDs) lasting > or =2 seconds are considered absence 
      seizures. The location of the absence seizures generators in IGEs is thought to 
      involve interplay between various components of thalamocortical circuits; we have 
      recently postulated that medication resistance may, in part, be related to the 
      location of the GSWD generators [Szaflarski JP, Lindsell CJ, Zakaria T, Banks C, 
      Privitera MD. Epilepsy Behav. 2010;17:525-30]. In the present study we 
      hypothesized that patients with medication-refractory IGE (R-IGE) and continued 
      absence seizures may have GSWD generators in locations other than the thalamus, 
      as typically seen in patients with IGE. Hence, the objective of this study was to 
      determine the location of the GSWD generators in patients with R-IGE using 
      EEG/fMRI. Eighty-three patients with IGE received concurrent EEG/fMRI at 4 T. 
      Nine of them (aged 15-55) experienced absence seizures during EEG/fMRI and were 
      included; all were diagnosed with R-IGE. Subjects participated in up to three 
      20-minute EEG/fMRI sessions (400 volumes, TR=3 seconds) performed at 4 T. After 
      removal of fMRI and ballistocardiographic artifacts, 36 absence seizures were 
      identified. Statistical parametric maps were generated for each of these sessions 
      correlating seizures to BOLD response. Timing differences between brain regions 
      were tested using statistical parametric maps generated by modeling seizures with 
      onset times shifted relative to the GSWD onsets. Although thalamic BOLD responses 
      peaked approximately 6 seconds after the onset of absence seizures, other areas 
      including the prefrontal and dorsolateral cortices showed brief and nonsustained 
      peaks occurring approximately 2 seconds prior to the maximum of the thalamic 
      peak. Temporal lobe peaks occurred at the same time as the thalamic peak, with a 
      cerebellar peak occurring approximately 1 second later. Confirmatory analysis 
      averaging cross-correlation between cortical and thalamic regions of interest 
      across seizures corroborated these findings. Finally, Granger causality analysis 
      showed effective connectivity directed from frontal lobe to thalamus, supporting 
      the notion of earlier frontal than thalamic involvement. The results of this 
      study support our original hypothesis and indicate that in the patients with 
      R-IGE studied, absence seizures may be initiated by widespread cortical (frontal 
      and parietal) areas and sustained in subcortical (thalamic) regions, suggesting 
      that the examined patients have cortical onset epilepsy with propagation to 
      thalamus.

TI  - Suppression of deep brain stimulation artifacts from the electroencephalogram by 
      frequency-domain Hampel filtering.
PG  - 1227-32
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2010.02.156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Currently, electroencephalography (EEG) cannot be used to record 
      cortical activity during clinically effective DBS due to the presence of large 
      stimulation artifact with components that overlap the useful spectrum of the EEG. 
      A filtering method is presented that removes these artifacts whilst preserving 
      the spectral and temporal fidelity of the underlying EEG. METHODS: The filter is 
      based on the Hampel identifier that treats artifacts as outliers in the frequency 
      domain and replaces them with interpolated values. Performance of the filter was 
      tested with a synthesized DBS signal and actual data recorded during bilateral 
      monopolar DBS. RESULTS: Mean increases in signal-to-noise ratio of 7.8dB for 
      single-frequency stimulation and 13.8dB for dual-frequency stimulation are 
      reported. Correlation analysis between EEG with synthesized artifacts and 
      artifact-free EEG reveals that distortion to the underlying EEG in the filtered 
      signal is negligible (r(2)>0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Frequency-domain Hampel filtering 
      has been shown to remove monopolar DBS artifacts under a number of common 
      stimulation conditions used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Application of frequency-domain Hampel filtering will allow the 
      measurement of EEG in patients during clinically effective DBS and thus may 
      increase our understanding of the mechanisms of action of this important 
      therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Comparison of spectral entropy and bispectral index electroencephalography in 
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
PG  - 544-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jvca.2009.09.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was to compare response entropy (RE) and state entropy 
      (SE) with bispectral index (BIS) electroencephalography (EEG) as an alternative 
      cerebral monitoring tool in patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft 
      surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, observational single-center study. SETTING: 
      University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery 
      bypass graft surgery receiving remifentanil-propofol anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac arrest in 15 
      patients, with CPB without cardiac arrest in 9 patients and without CPB in 6 
      patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: RE, SE, BIS, burst suppression ratio 
      (BSR), and frontal electromyography (f-EMG) were detected simultaneously. RE and 
      SE compared favorably with BIS and their correlations were strong (r(2) = 0.6, 
      r(2) = 0.55, respectively). The mean bias of RE and BIS was -1.8, but limits of 
      agreement were high (+20.5/-24.1). RE and SE tended to be lower than the BIS 
      values in the CPB subgroups. The detection of BSR was similar with RE and SE and 
      the BIS. A strong correlation existed between BIS and f-EMG (r(2) = 0.62) in 
      contrast to RE (r(2) = 0.45) and SE (r(2) =0.39). BIS monitoring was 
      significantly more disturbed than RE and SE with 9.1% +/-10.9% and 0.1% +/- 0.2% 
      of the total anesthesia time, respectively. Neither implicit nor explicit memory 
      was shown. CONCLUSION: RE and SE are comparable with the BIS but showed 
      significantly less interference from f-EMG and superior resistance against 
      artifacts. Thus, spectral entropy is more suitable than the BIS during 
      propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in cardiac surgery patients.

TI  - Identifying robust and sensitive frequency bands for interrogating neural 
      oscillations.
PG  - 1319-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.037 [doi]
AB  - Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in using neural oscillations to 
      characterize the mechanisms supporting cognition and emotion. Oftentimes, 
      oscillatory activity is indexed by mean power density in predefined frequency 
      bands. Some investigators use broad bands originally defined by prominent surface 
      features of the spectrum. Others rely on narrower bands originally defined by 
      spectral factor analysis (SFA). Presently, the robustness and sensitivity of 
      these competing band definitions remains unclear. Here, a Monte Carlo-based SFA 
      strategy was used to decompose the tonic ("resting" or "spontaneous") 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) into five bands: delta (1-5Hz), alpha-low (6-9Hz), 
      alpha-high (10-11Hz), beta (12-19Hz), and gamma (>21Hz). This pattern was 
      consistent across SFA methods, artifact correction/rejection procedures, scalp 
      regions, and samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that SFA failed to deliver 
      enhanced sensitivity; narrow alpha sub-bands proved no more sensitive than the 
      classical broadband to individual differences in temperament or mean differences 
      in task-induced activation. Other analyses suggested that residual ocular and 
      muscular artifact was the dominant source of activity during quiescence in the 
      delta and gamma bands. This was observed following threshold-based artifact 
      rejection or independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction, 
      indicating that such procedures do not necessarily confer adequate protection. 
      Collectively, these findings highlight the limitations of several commonly used 
      EEG procedures and underscore the necessity of routinely performing exploratory 
      data analyses, particularly data visualization, prior to hypothesis testing. They 
      also suggest the potential benefits of using techniques other than SFA for 
      interrogating high-dimensional EEG datasets in the frequency or time-frequency 
      (event-related spectral perturbation, event-related 
      synchronization/desynchronization) domains.

AB  - A real-time neonatal seizure detection system is proposed based on a Gaussian 
      mixture model classifier. The system includes feature transformation techniques 
      and classifier output postprocessing. The detector was evaluated on a database of 
      20 patients with 330 h of recordings. A detailed analysis of the choice of 
      parameters for the detector is provided. A mean good detection rate of 79% was 
      obtained with only 0.5 false detections per hour. A thorough review of all 
      misclassified events was performed, from which a number of patterns causing false 
      detections were identified.

AB  - Understanding the basic neural processes that underlie complex higher-order 
      cognitive operations and functional domains is a fundamental goal of cognitive 
      neuroscience. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and relatively 
      inexpensive method for assessing neurophysiological function that can be used to 
      achieve this goal. EEG measures the electrical activity of large, synchronously 
      firing populations of neurons in the brain with electrodes placed on the scalp. 
      This unit outlines the basics of setting up an EEG experiment with human 
      participants, including equipment, and a step-by-step guide to applying and 
      preparing an electrode cap. Also included are support protocols for two 
      event-related potential (ERP) paradigms, P50 suppression, and mismatch negativity 
      (MMN), which are measures of early sensory processing. These paradigms can be 
      used to assess the integrity of early sensory processing in normal individuals 
      and clinical populations, such as individuals with schizophrenia.

AB  - Mismatch negativity (MMN) is measured by subtracting the averaged response to a 
      set of standard stimuli from the averaged response to rarer deviant stimuli, and 
      taking the amplitude of this difference wave in a given time window. This method 
      is problematic when used to evaluate individuals, because there is no estimate of 
      variance. We describe a new approach, in which independent components with high 
      trial-by-trial variance are first removed. Next, each deviant response has the 
      preceding standard response subtracted, giving a set of single trial difference 
      waves. We illustrate this approach in analysis of MMN to brief tones in 17 
      adults. The best criterion for MMN combined t-test with an index of inter-trial 
      coherence, giving significant MMN in 14 (82%) of individuals. Single-trial 
      methods can indicate which people show MMN. However, in some clinically normal 
      individuals there was no MMN, despite good behavioral discrimination of stimuli.

TI  - Extraction of single-trial cortical beta oscillatory activities in EEG signals 
      using empirical mode decomposition.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-9-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain oscillatory activities are stochastic and non-linearly dynamic, 
      due to their non-phase-locked nature and inter-trial variability. 
      Non-phase-locked rhythmic signals can vary from trial-to-trial dependent upon 
      variations in a subject's performance and state, which may be linked to 
      fluctuations in expectation, attention, arousal, and task strategy. Therefore, a 
      method that permits the extraction of the oscillatory signal on a single-trial 
      basis is important for the study of subtle brain dynamics, which can be used as 
      probes to study neurophysiology in normal brain and pathophysiology in the 
      diseased. METHODS: This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition 
      (EMD)-based spatiotemporal approach to extract neural oscillatory activities from 
      multi-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) data. The efficacy of this approach 
      manifests in extracting single-trial post-movement beta activities when 
      performing a right index-finger lifting task. In each single trial, an EEG epoch 
      recorded at the channel of interest (CI) was first separated into a number of 
      intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Sensorimotor-related oscillatory activities were 
      reconstructed from sensorimotor-related IMFs chosen by a spatial map matching 
      process. Post-movement beta activities were acquired by band-pass filtering the 
      sensorimotor-related oscillatory activities within a trial-specific beta band. 
      Signal envelopes of post-movement beta activities were detected using amplitude 
      modulation (AM) method to obtain post-movement beta event-related synchronization 
      (PM-bERS). The maximum amplitude in the PM-bERS within the post-movement period 
      was subtracted by the mean amplitude of the reference period to find the 
      single-trial beta rebound (BR). RESULTS: The results showed single-trial BRs 
      computed by the current method were significantly higher than those obtained from 
      conventional average method (P < 0.01; matched-pair Wilcoxon test). The proposed 
      method provides high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through an EMD-based 
      decomposition and reconstruction process, which enables event-related oscillatory 
      activities to be examined on a single-trial basis. CONCLUSIONS: The EMD-based 
      method is effective for artefact removal and extracting reliable neural features 
      of non-phase-locked oscillatory activities in multi-channel EEG data. The high 
      extraction rate of the proposed method enables the trial-by-trial variability of 
      oscillatory activities can be examined, which provide a possibility for future 
      profound study of subtle brain dynamics.

AB  - A 40 year old man was admitted to the EEG monitoring unit for localization of 
      epileptic focus and changes in medication regimen. The patient had undergone left 
      frontal lobe resection during childhood for unknown pathology (Fig.1 A). 
      Subsequently he developed secondary epilepsy characterized by nocturnal complex 
      partial seizures with occasional secondary generalization. During the first two 
      days of monitoring, a persistent myogenic artifact was seen localized to the T3 
      EEG electrode (Fig. 1 C). The artifact prevented localization of the patient’s 
      clinical seizure during monitoring. We attributed the artifact to excessive 
      muscle activity, as electrode lead replacement and repositioning did not resolve 
      the artifact. The persistent muscle activity in the left temporalis was likely 
      due to surgical-induced muscle damage (Fig.1 B). On the third monitoring day, a 
      total of 80 units of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) were injected in the 
      temporalis muscle, at four locations around the T3 electrode. The artifact 
      disappeared completely within three days, demonstrating F7 interictal discharges 
      (Fig.1 D) and the focal onset of ictal activity at F7-T3 (Fig.1 E). No 
      BTX-A-related side effects were reported by the patient.

TI  - Removal of movement artifact from high-density EEG recorded during walking and 
      running.
PG  - 3526-34
LID - 10.1152/jn.00105.2010 [doi]
AB  - Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor actions, most studies 
      of human brain dynamics examine subjects in static seated or prone conditions. 
      EEG signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow 
      recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a 
      channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial 
      filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from EEG signals 
      recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove 
      gait artifact from high-density EEG recorded during a visual oddball 
      discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax 
      independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced EEG 
      signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then performed 
      component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus 
      component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in 
      the 1.5- to 8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking 
      conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials 
      (ERPs), which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while 
      standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running 
      condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG signals: stable 
      average ERP time-courses of IC processes were only detectable after artifact 
      removal. These findings show that high-density EEG can be used to study brain 
      dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic 
      gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.

TI  - Removal of BCG artifacts from EEG recordings inside the MR scanner: a comparison 
      of methodological and validation-related aspects.

AB  - Multimodal approaches are of growing interest in the study of neural processes. 
      To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous 
      acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with 
      amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most 
      challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused 
      by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous 
      efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, still a considerable 
      discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to 
      clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an 
      extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, 
      Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods 
      were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known 
      from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on 
      task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These 
      more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction 
      between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able 
      to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed more parameter tuning, 
      thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to 
      ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the 
      effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.

TI  - Physical modeling of pulse artefact sources in simultaneous EEG/fMRI.
PG  - 604-20
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20891 [doi]
AB  - The collection of electroencephalography (EEG) data during simultaneous 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is impeded by large artefacts in the 
      EEG recordings, with the pulse artefact (PA) being particularly challenging 
      because of its persistence even after application of artefact correction 
      algorithms. Despite several possible causes of the PA having been hypothesized, 
      few studies have rigorously quantified the contributions from the different 
      putative sources. This article presents analytic expressions and simulations 
      describing two possible sources of the PA corresponding to different movements in 
      the strong static field of the MR scanner: cardiac-pulse-driven head rotation and 
      blood-flow-induced Hall voltages. Models of head rotation about a left-right axis 
      and flow in a deep artery running in the anterior-posterior direction reproduced 
      properties of the PA including the left/right spatial variation of polarity. Of 
      these two sources, head rotation was shown to be the most likely source of the PA 
      with simulated magnitudes of >200 muV being generated at 3 T, similar to the in 
      vivo PA magnitudes, for an angular velocity of just 0.5 degrees /s. Smaller 
      artefact voltages of less than 10 muV were calculated for flow in a model artery 
      with physical characteristics similar to the internal carotid artery. A deeper 
      physical understanding of the PA is a key step in working toward production of 
      higher fidelity EEG/fMRI data: analytic expressions for the artefact voltages can 
      guide a redesign of the wiring layout on EEG caps to minimize intrinsic artefact 
      pickup, while simulated artefact maps could be incorporated into selective 
      filters.

TI  - Dynamics of electroencephalogram entropy and pitfalls of scaling detection.
PG  - 031909
AB  - In recent studies a number of research groups have determined that human 
      electroencephalograms (EEG) have scaling properties. In particular, a crossover 
      between two regions with different scaling exponents has been reported. Herein we 
      study the time evolution of diffusion entropy to elucidate the scaling of EEG 
      time series. For a cohort of 20 awake healthy volunteers with closed eyes, we 
      find that the diffusion entropy of EEG increments (obtained from EEG waveforms by 
      differencing) exhibits three features: short-time growth, an alpha wave related 
      oscillation whose amplitude gradually decays in time, and asymptotic saturation 
      which is achieved after approximately 1 s. This analysis suggests a linear, 
      stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Langevin equation with a quasiperiodic forcing 
      (whose frequency and/or amplitude may vary in time) as the model for the 
      underlying dynamics. This model captures the salient properties of EEG dynamics. 
      In particular, both the experimental and simulated EEG time series exhibit 
      short-time scaling which is broken by a strong periodic component, such as alpha 
      waves. The saturation of EEG diffusion entropy precludes the existence of 
      asymptotic scaling. We find that the crossover between two scaling regions seen 
      in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of EEG increments does not originate from 
      the underlying dynamics but is merely an artifact of the algorithm. This artifact 
      is rooted in the failure of the "trend plus signal" paradigm of DFA.

TI  - Pitfalls of high-pass filtering for detecting epileptic oscillations: a technical 
      note on "false" ripples.
PG  - 301-10
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.10.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze interictal High frequency oscillations (HFOs) as observed 
      in the medial temporal lobe of epileptic patients and animals (ripples, 80-200Hz 
      and fast ripples, 250-600Hz). To show that the identification of interictal HFOs 
      raises some methodological issues, as the filtering of sharp transients (e.g., 
      epileptic spikes or artefacts) or signals with harmonics can result in "false" 
      ripples. To illustrate and quantify the occurrence of false ripples on filtered 
      EEG traces. METHODS: We have performed high-pass filtering on both simulated and 
      real data. We have also used two alternate methods: time-frequency analysis and 
      matching pursuit. RESULTS: Two types of events were shown to produce oscillations 
      after filtering that could be confounded with actual oscillatory activity: sharp 
      transients and harmonics of non-sinusoidal signals. CONCLUSIONS: High-pass 
      filtering of EEG traces for detection of oscillatory activity should be performed 
      with great care. Filtered traces should be compared to original traces for 
      verification of presence of transients. Additional techniques such as 
      time-frequency transforms or sparse decompositions are highly beneficial. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our study draws the attention on an issue of great importance in 
      the marking of HFOs on EEG traces. We illustrate complementary methods that can 
      help both researchers and clinicians.

TI  - Radio frequency noise from an MLC: a feasibility study of the use of an MLC for 
      linac-MR systems.
PG  - 981-94
LID - 10.1088/0031-9155/55/4/005 [doi]
AB  - Currently several groups are actively researching the integration of a 
      megavoltage teletherapy unit with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for real-time 
      image-guided radiotherapy. The use of a multileaf collimator (MLC) for 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy for linac-MR units must be investigated. The MLC 
      itself will likely reside in the fringe field of the MR and the motors will 
      produce radio frequency (RF) noise. The RF noise power spectral density from a 
      Varian 52-leaf MLC motor, a Varian Millennium MLC motor and a brushless fan motor 
      has been measured as a function of the applied magnetic field using a near field 
      probe set. For the Varian 52-leaf MLC system, the RF noise produced by 13 of 52 
      motors is studied as a function of distance from the MLC. Data are reported in 
      the frequency range suitable for 0.2-1.5 T linac-MR systems. Below 40 MHz the 
      Millennium MLC motor tested showed more noise than the Varian 52-leaf motor or 
      the brushless fan motor. The brushless motor showed a small dependence on the 
      applied magnetic field. Images of a phantom were taken by the prototype linac-MR 
      system with the MLC placed in close proximity to the magnet. Several orientations 
      of the MLC in both shielded and non-shielded configurations were studied. For the 
      case of a non-shielded MLC and associated cables, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
      was reduced when 13 of 52 MLC leaves were moved during imaging. When the MLC and 
      associated cables were shielded, the measured SNR of the images with 13 MLC 
      leaves moving was experimentally the same as the SNR of the stationary MLC image. 
      When the MLC and cables are shielded, subtraction images acquired with and 
      without MLC motion contains no systematic signal. This study illustrates that the 
      small RF noise produced by functioning MLC motors can be effectively shielded to 
      avoid SNR degradation. A functioning MLC can be incorporated into a linac-MR 
      unit.

TI  - MEG detection of delayed auditory evoked responses in autism spectrum disorders: 
      towards an imaging biomarker for autism.
PG  - 8-18
LID - 10.1002/aur.111 [doi]
AB  - Motivated by auditory and speech deficits in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the 
      frequency dependence of superior temporal gyrus (STG) 50 msec (M50) and 100 msec 
      (M100) neuromagnetic auditory evoked field responses in children with ASD and 
      typically developing controls were evaluated. Whole-cortex magnetoencephalography 
      (MEG) was obtained from 17 typically developing children and 25 children with 
      ASD. Subjects were presented tones with frequencies of 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 
      Hz, and left and right STG M50 and M100 STG activity was examined. No M50 latency 
      or amplitude Group differences were observed. In the right hemisphere, a Group x 
      Frequency ANOVA on M100 latency produced a main effect for Group (P=0.01), with 
      an average M100 latency delay of 11 msec in children with ASD. In addition, only 
      in the control group was the expected association of earlier M100 latencies in 
      older than younger children observed. Group latency differences remained 
      significant when hierarchical regression analyses partialed out M100 variance 
      associated with age, IQ, and language ability (all P-values <0.05). Examining the 
      right-hemisphere 500 Hz condition (where the largest latency differences were 
      observed), a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 81%, and a positive predictive 
      value (PPV) of 86% was obtained at a threshold of 116 msec. The M100 latency 
      delay indicates disruption of encoding simple sensory information. Given similar 
      findings in language impaired and non-language impaired ASD subjects, a 
      right-hemisphere M100 latency delay appears to be an electrophysiological 
      endophenotype for autism.

TI  - Rectification of the EMG signal impairs the identification of oscillatory input 
      to the muscle.
PG  - 1093-103
LID - 10.1152/jn.00792.2009 [doi]
AB  - Rectification of EMG signals is a common processing step used when performing 
      electroencephalographic-electromyographic (EEG-EMG) coherence and EMG-EMG 
      coherence. It is well known, however, that EMG rectification alters the power 
      spectrum of the recorded EMG signal (interference EMG). The purpose of this study 
      was to determine whether rectification of the EMG signal influences the 
      capability of capturing the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the 
      common oscillations between two EMG signals. Several EMG signals were 
      reconstructed from experimentally recorded EMG signals from the surface of the 
      first dorsal interosseus muscle and were manipulated to have an oscillatory input 
      or common input (for pairs of reconstructed EMG signals) at various frequency 
      bands (in Hz: 0-12, 12-30, 30-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300, and 
      300-400), one at a time. The absolute integral and normalized integral of power, 
      peak power, and peak coherence (for pairs of EMG signals) were quantified from 
      each frequency band. The power spectrum of the interference EMG accurately 
      detected the changes to the oscillatory input to the reconstructed EMG signal, 
      whereas the power spectrum of the rectified EMG did not. Similarly, the EMG-EMG 
      coherence between two interference EMG signals accurately detected the common 
      input to the pairs of reconstructed EMG signals, whereas the EMG-EMG coherence 
      between two rectified EMG signals did not. The frequency band from 12 to 30 Hz in 
      the power spectrum of the rectified EMG and the EMG-EMG coherence between two 
      rectified signals was influenced by the input from 100 to 150 Hz but not from the 
      input from 12 to 30 Hz. The study concludes that the power spectrum of the EMG 
      and EMG-EMG coherence should be performed on interference EMG signals and not on 
      rectified EMG signals because rectification impairs the identification of the 
      oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillatory input between 
      two EMG signals.

TI  - Good practices in EEG-MRI: the utility of retrospective synchronization and PCA 
      for the removal of MRI gradient artefacts.
PG  - 2287-303
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.050 [doi]
AB  - The electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      inside the scanner is obstructed by the MRI gradient artefact (MGA) originating 
      from the electromagnetic interference of the MRI with the sensitive measurement 
      of electrical scalp potentials. Post-processing algorithms based on average 
      artefact subtraction (AAS) have proven to be efficient in removing the MGA. 
      However, the residual MGA after AAS still limits the quality and usable bandwidth 
      of the EEG data despite further reduction through re-sampling, principal 
      component analysis (PCA), and regressive filtering. We recently demonstrated that 
      the residual MGA can largely be avoided by means of hardware synchronization. 
      Here we present a new software synchronization method, which substitutes hardware 
      synchronization and facilitates the removal of motion artefacts by PCA. The 
      effectiveness of the retrospective synchronization algorithm (Resync) is 
      demonstrated by comparison to the aforementioned techniques. For this purpose, we 
      also developed a method for simulating the MGA and we propose new concepts for 
      quantifying and comparing the performance of post-processing algorithms for 
      EEG-MRI data. Results indicate that the benefits of (retrospective) 
      synchronization and PCA depend largely on the relative contribution of timing 
      errors and motion artefacts to the residual MGA as well as the frequency range of 
      interest.

TI  - Validation of ICA-based myogenic artifact correction for scalp and 
      source-localized EEG.
PG  - 2416-32
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.010 [doi]
AB  - Muscle electrical activity, or "electromyogenic" (EMG) artifact, poses a serious 
      threat to the validity of electroencephalography (EEG) investigations in the 
      frequency domain. EMG is sensitive to a variety of psychological processes and 
      can mask genuine effects or masquerade as legitimate neurogenic effects across 
      the scalp in frequencies at least as low as the alpha band (8-13 Hz). Although 
      several techniques for correcting myogenic activity have been described, most are 
      subjected to only limited validation attempts. Attempts to gauge the impact of 
      EMG correction on intracerebral source models (source "localization" analyses) 
      are rarer still. Accordingly, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of one 
      prominent correction tool, independent component analysis (ICA), on the scalp and 
      in the source-space using high-resolution EEG. Data were collected from 17 
      participants while neurogenic and myogenic activity was independently varied. 
      Several protocols for classifying and discarding components classified as 
      myogenic and non-myogenic artifact (e.g., ocular) were systematically assessed, 
      leading to the exclusion of one-third to as much as three-quarters of the 
      variance in the EEG. Some, but not all, of these protocols showed adequate 
      performance on the scalp. Indeed, performance was superior to previously 
      validated regression-based techniques. Nevertheless, ICA-based EMG correction 
      exhibited low validity in the intracerebral source-space, likely owing to 
      incomplete separation of neurogenic from myogenic sources. Taken with prior work, 
      this indicates that EMG artifact can substantially distort estimates of 
      intracerebral spectral activity. Neither regression- nor ICA-based EMG correction 
      techniques provide complete safeguards against such distortions. In light of 
      these results, several practical suggestions and recommendations are made for 
      intelligently using ICA to minimize EMG and other common artifacts.

TI  - Correction for pulse height variability reduces physiological noise in functional 
      MRI when studying spontaneous brain activity.
PG  - 311-25
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20866 [doi]
AB  - EEG correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) allows the delineation of the areas 
      corresponding to spontaneous brain activity, such as epileptiform spikes or alpha 
      rhythm. A major problem of fMRI analysis in general is that spurious correlations 
      may occur because fMRI signals are not only correlated with the phenomena of 
      interest, but also with physiological processes, like cardiac and respiratory 
      functions. The aim of this study was to reduce the number of falsely detected 
      activated areas by taking the variation in physiological functioning into account 
      in the general linear model (GLM). We used the photoplethysmogram (PPG), since 
      this signal is based on a linear combination of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in the 
      arterial blood, which is also the basis of fMRI. We derived a regressor from the 
      variation in pulse height (VIPH) of PPG and added this regressor to the GLM. When 
      this regressor was used as predictor it appeared that VIPH explained a large part 
      of the variance of fMRI signals acquired from five epilepsy patients and thirteen 
      healthy volunteers. As a confounder VIPH reduced the number of activated voxels 
      by 30% for the healthy volunteers, when studying the generators of the alpha 
      rhythm. Although for the patients the number of activated voxels either decreased 
      or increased, the identification of the epileptogenic zone was substantially 
      enhanced in one out of five patients, whereas for the other patients the effects 
      were smaller. In conclusion, applying VIPH as a confounder diminishes 
      physiological noise and allows a more reliable interpretation of fMRI results.

TI  - Improving the response of accelerometers for automotive applications by using LMS 
      adaptive filters.
PG  - 313-29
LID - 10.3390/s100100313 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm was used to eliminate noise 
      corrupting the important information coming from a piezoresisitive accelerometer 
      for automotive applications. This kind of accelerometer is designed to be easily 
      mounted in hard to reach places on vehicles under test, and they usually feature 
      ranges from 50 to 2,000 g (where is the gravitational acceleration, 9.81 m/s(2)) 
      and frequency responses to 3,000 Hz or higher, with DC response, durable cables, 
      reliable performance and relatively low cost. However, here we show that the 
      response of the sensor under test had a lot of noise and we carried out the 
      signal processing stage by using both conventional and optimal adaptive 
      filtering. Usually, designers have to build their specific analog and digital 
      signal processing circuits, and this fact increases considerably the cost of the 
      entire sensor system and the results are not always satisfactory, because the 
      relevant signal is sometimes buried in a broad-band noise background where the 
      unwanted information and the relevant signal sometimes share a very similar 
      frequency band. Thus, in order to deal with this problem, here we used the LMS 
      adaptive filtering algorithm and compare it with others based on the kind of 
      filters that are typically used for automotive applications. The experimental 
      results are satisfactory.

AB  - This study's primary objective is to analyze human EEG spindle oscillations 
      during propofol-induced anesthesia and to address possible activation sources. 
      Such an analysis also has a secondary role of investigating the short- term 
      spectral patterns and their functional role.Artifact-free epochs of spindle 
      activations were selected from the electroencephalograms of patients undergoing 
      propofol anesthesia. Power spectral analysis and source localization using 
      standardized low-resolution-brain-electromagnetic-tomography (sLORETA) were 
      performed. Additionally, spectrograms were obtained by means of using the Complex 
      Morlet-based algorithm. In order to highlight the functional properties, auditory 
      stimulations were conducted during the propofol administration. The loss of 
      consciousness was reached at a level of 0.8-1.2 µg/mL, which also provided 
      distinct spindle oscillations in the continuous EEG. The un-evoked (spontaneous) 
      and evoked (auditory) conditions were examined across non-medicated and medicated 
      conditions (propofol). The propofol administration resulted in appearance of 
      12-14 Hz spindle activity mostly localized in BA6, BA9, BA10, BA21, BA24 and BA37 
      areas. The presence of auditory stimulations slightly shifted these maximum 
      activities to different locations. Between the medicated and non-medicated 
      conditions, there was a significant reduction of spindle activity, which was 
      pinpointed to BA7 (precuneus area). The findings indicate that spindle 
      oscillations may have a dual nature. That is, spindle oscillations may be 
      activity dependent and disruptive for large-scale information processing networks 
      in the brain. Hence, the study of spindle oscillation may provide a basis for 
      understanding the short-term spectral patterns of human EEG.

PG  - 642-5
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627244 [doi]
AB  - Real signals are often corrupted by noise. In applications where the noise power 
      spectrum is variable with time, dynamic noise estimation and compensation can 
      potentially improve the performance of signal processing algorithms. One such 
      application is scalp EEG monitoring in epilepsy, where the electrical activity 
      generated by cranio-facial muscle contraction and expansion, often obscures the 
      measured brainwave signals. This work presents a data reduction algorithm which 
      is based on differentiating interictal from normal background activity, in 
      epileptic scalp EEG signals, using a modified phase congruency technique. The 
      modification is based on dynamically estimating muscle activity from the signal 
      and incorporating this estimation in phase congruency computations. The proposed 
      algorithm identifies 90%of interictal spikes whilst transmitting only 45% of EEG 
      data. This is in the order of 15% improvement in data reduction when compared to 
      the performance obtained with the state-of-the-art denoised phase 
      congruency-which calculates a constant noise threshold-applied to the same 
      dataset.

TI  - Brain responses evoked by high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation: an event-related potential study.
PG  - 2-14
LID - 10.1016/j.brs.2009.04.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many recent studies have used repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) to study brain-behavior relationships. However, the 
      pulse-to-pulse neural effects of rapid delivery of multiple TMS pulses are 
      unknown largely because of TMS-evoked electrical artifacts limiting recording of 
      brain activity.ObjectiveIn this study, TMS-related artifacts were removed with 
      independent component analysis (ICA), which allowed for the investigation of the 
      neurophysiologic effects of rTMS with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      recordings. METHODS: Repetitive TMS trains of 10 Hz, 3 seconds (110% of motor 
      threshold) were delivered to the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule 
      in 16 young adults. Simultaneous EEG recordings were made with a TMS-compatible 
      system. The stereotypical pattern of TMS-related electrical artifacts was 
      identified by ICA. RESULTS: Removal of artifacts allowed for identification of a 
      series of five evoked brain potentials occurring within 100 milliseconds of each 
      TMS pulse. With the exception of the first potential, for both areas targeted, 
      there was a quadratic relationship between potential peak amplitude and pulse 
      number within the TMS train. This was characterized by a decrease, followed by a 
      rise in amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: ICA is an effective method for removal of 
      TMS-evoked electrical artifacts in EEG data. With the use of this procedure we 
      found that the physiologic responses to TMS pulses delivered in a high-frequency 
      train of pulses are not independent. The sensitivity of the magnitude of these 
      responses to recent stimulation history suggests a complex recruitment of 
      multiple neuronal events with different temporal dynamics.

AB  - The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous 
      electroencephalography (EEG) provides us the possibility to non-invasively probe 
      the brain's excitability, time-resolved connectivity and instantaneous state. 
      Early attempts to combine TMS and EEG suffered from the huge electromagnetic 
      artifacts seen in EEG as a result of the electric field induced by the stimulus 
      pulses. To deal with this problem, TMS-compatible EEG systems have been 
      developed. However, even with amplifiers that are either immune to or recover 
      quickly from the pulse, great challenges remain. Artifacts may arise from the 
      movement of electrodes, from muscles activated by the pulse, from eye movements, 
      from electrode polarization, or from brain responses evoked by the coil click. 
      With careful precautions, many of these problems can be avoided. The remaining 
      artifacts can be usually reduced by filtering, but control experiments are often 
      needed to make sure that the measured signals actually originate in the brain. 
      Several studies have shown the power of TMS-EEG by giving us valuable information 
      about the excitability or connectivity of the brain.

TI  - Independent component analysis reveals dynamic ictal BOLD responses in EEG-fMRI 
      data from focal epilepsy patients.
PG  - 366-78
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.064 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Seizures occur rarely during EEG-fMRI acquisitions of epilepsy 
      patients, but can potentially offer a better estimation of the epileptogenic zone 
      than interictal activity. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven 
      method that imposes minimal constraints on the hemodynamic response function 
      (HRF). In particular, the investigation of HRFs with clear peaks, but varying 
      latency, may be used to differentiate the ictal focus from propagated activity. 
      METHODS: ICA was applied on ictal EEG-fMRI data from 15 patients. Components 
      related to seizures were identified by fitting an HRF to the component time 
      courses at the time of the ictal EEG events. HRFs with a clear peak were used to 
      derive maps of significant BOLD responses and their associated peak delay. The 
      results were then compared with those obtained from a general linear model (GLM) 
      method. Concordance with the presumed epileptogenic focus was also assessed. 
      RESULTS: The ICA maps were significantly correlated with the GLM maps for each 
      patient (Spearman's test, p<0.05). The ictal BOLD responses identified by ICA 
      always included the presumed epileptogenic zone, but were also more widespread, 
      accounting for 20.3% of the brain volume on average. The method provided a 
      classification of the components as a function of peak delay. BOLD response 
      clusters associated with early HRF peaks were concordant with the suspected 
      epileptogenic focus, while subsequent HRF peaks may correspond to ictal 
      propagation. CONCLUSION: ICA applied to EEG-fMRI can detect areas of significant 
      BOLD response to ictal events without having to predefine an HRF. By estimating 
      the HRF peak time in each identified region, the method could also potentially 
      provide a dynamic analysis of ictal BOLD responses, distinguishing onset from 
      propagated activity.

TI  - Single-trial classification of NIRS signals during emotional induction tasks: 
      towards a corporeal machine interface.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-6-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corporeal machine interfaces (CMIs) are one of a few available 
      options for restoring communication and environmental control to those with 
      severe motor impairments. Cognitive processes detectable solely with functional 
      imaging technologies such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can potentially 
      provide interfaces requiring less user training than conventional 
      electroencephalography-based CMIs. We hypothesized that visually-cued emotional 
      induction tasks can elicit forehead hemodynamic activity that can be harnessed 
      for a CMI. METHODS: Data were collected from ten able-bodied participants as they 
      performed trials of positively and negatively-emotional induction tasks. A 
      genetic algorithm was employed to select the optimal signal features, classifier, 
      task valence (positive or negative emotional value of the stimulus), recording 
      site, and signal analysis interval length for each participant. We compared the 
      performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine 
      classifiers. The latency of the NIRS hemodynamic response was estimated as the 
      time required for classification accuracy to stabilize. RESULTS: Baseline and 
      activation sequences were classified offline with accuracies upwards of 75.0%. 
      Feature selection identified common time-domain discriminatory features across 
      participants. Classification performance varied with the length of the input 
      signal, and optimal signal length was found to be feature-dependent. 
      Statistically significant increases in classification accuracy from baseline 
      rates were observed as early as 2.5 s from initial stimulus presentation. 
      CONCLUSION: NIRS signals during affective states were shown to be distinguishable 
      from baseline states with classification accuracies significantly above chance 
      levels. Further research with NIRS for corporeal machine interfaces is warranted.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of 
      magnetoencephalography in epilepsy patients with a vagus nerve stimulator. 
      Magnetoencephalography was performed in two patients with medically intractable 
      epilepsy who had a vagus nerve stimulator. Because of the artifacts caused by the 
      vagus nerve stimulator, no spikes could be identified in the original 
      magnetoencephalographic data in either patient. The temporally extended signal 
      space separation method was used to remove artifacts. After processing by this 
      method, left temporoparietal spikes were clearly identified in patient 1. 
      Equivalent current dipoles calculated from these spikes were localized in the 
      left posterior-temporal and parietal lobes. The location of the dipoles was 
      consistent with the spike distribution on intracranial electroencephalography. In 
      patient 2, bilateral diffuse spikes were seen in the processed data. The contour 
      maps demonstrated a bilateral pattern, not in agreement with a single focal 
      source. These findings supported the diagnosis of symptomatic generalized 
      epilepsy in this patient. Magnetoencephalography may thus be a useful option for 
      evaluating patients with intractable epilepsy who have a vagus nerve stimulator.

AB  - The discontinuous patterns in neonatal magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data are 
      quantified with a novel Hilbert phase (HP) based approach. The expert 
      neurologists' scores were used as the gold standard. The performance of this 
      approach was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and 
      it was compared with two other approaches, namely spectral ratio (SR) and 
      discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that have been proposed for the detection of 
      discontinuous patterns in neonatal EEG. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 
      used as a performance measure. AUCs obtained for SR, HP, and DWT were 0.87, 0.80, 
      and 0.56, respectively. Although the performance of HP was lower than SR, it 
      carries information about the frequency content of the signal that helps to 
      distinguish brain patterns from artifacts such as cardiac residuals. Based on 
      this property, the HP approach was extended to fetal MEG data. Further, using the 
      frequency property of the HP approach, burst duration and interburst interval 
      were computed for the discontinuous patterns detected and they are in agreement 
      with reported values.

PG  - 348-61
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.072 [doi]
AB  - EEG data acquired in an MRI scanner are heavily contaminated by gradient 
      artifacts that can significantly compromise signal quality. We developed two new 
      methods based on independent component analysis (ICA) for reducing gradient 
      artifacts from spiral in-out and echo-planar pulse sequences at 3 T, and compared 
      our algorithms with four other commonly used methods: average artifact 
      subtraction (Allen, P., Josephs, O., Turner, R., 2000. A method for removing 
      imaging artifact from continuous EEG recorded during functional MRI. NeuroImage 
      12, 230-239.), principal component analysis (Niazy, R., Beckmann, C., Iannetti, 
      G., Brady, J., Smith, S., 2005. Removal of FMRI environment artifacts from EEG 
      data using optimal basis sets. NeuroImage 28, 720-737.), Taylor series ( Wan, X., 
      Iwata, K., Riera, J., Kitamura, M., Kawashima, R., 2006. Artifact reduction for 
      simultaneous EEG/fMRI recording: adaptive FIR reduction of imaging artifacts. 
      Clin. Neurophysiol. 117, 681-692.) and a conventional temporal ICA algorithm. 
      Models of gradient artifacts were derived from simulations as well as a water 
      phantom and performance of each method was evaluated on datasets constructed 
      using visual event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as resting EEG. Our new 
      methods recovered ERPs and resting EEG below the beta band (<12.5 Hz) with high 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR>4). Our algorithms outperformed all of these methods 
      on resting EEG in the theta and alpha bands (SNR>4); however, for all methods, 
      signal recovery was modest (SNR approximately 1) in the beta band and poor 
      (SNR<0.3) in the gamma band and above. We found that the conventional ICA 
      algorithm performed poorly with uniformly low SNR (<0.1). Taken together, our new 
      ICA-based methods offer a more robust technique for gradient artifact reduction 
      when scanning at 3 T using spiral in-out and echo-planar pulse sequences. We 
      provide new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method using a 
      unified subspace framework.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unremitting fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, hallmark traits of 
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), are also pathognomonic of sleep disorders. Yet, 
      no reproducible perturbations of sleep architecture, multiple sleep latency times 
      or Epworth Sleepiness Scores are found to be associated consistently with CFS. 
      This led us to hypothesize that sleep homeostasis, rather than sleep 
      architecture, may be perturbed in CFS. To probe this hypothesis, we measured and 
      compared EEG frequencies associated with restorative sleep between persons with 
      CFS and matched controls, both derived from a population-based sample. METHODS: 
      We evaluated overnight polysomnography (PSG) in 35 CFS and 40 control subjects. 
      PSG records were manually scored and epochs containing artifact removed. Fast 
      Fourier Transformation was utilized to deconstruct individual EEG signals into 
      primary frequency bands of alpha, delta, theta, sigma, and beta frequency 
      domains. The spectral power of each frequency domain for each sleep state was 
      compared between persons with CFS and matched controls. RESULTS: In persons with 
      CFS, delta power was diminished during slow wave sleep, but elevated during both 
      stage 1 and REM. Alpha power was reduced during stage 2, slow wave, and REM 
      sleep. Those with CFS also had significantly lower theta, sigma, and beta 
      spectral power during stage 2, Slow Wave Sleep, and REM. DISCUSSION: Employing 
      quantitative EEG analysis we demonstrate reduced spectral power of cortical delta 
      activity during SWS. We also establish reduced spectral power of cortical alpha 
      activity, with the greatest reduction occurring during REM sleep. Reductions in 
      theta, beta, and sigma spectral power were also apparent. CONCLUSION: Unremitting 
      fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, the waking manifestations of CFS, may be the 
      consequence of impaired sleep homeostasis rather than a primary sleep disorder.

TI  - Simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI: removal of gradient artifacts by subtraction of 
      head movement related average artifact waveforms.
PG  - 3361-77
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20758 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) are corrupted by large repetitive artifacts generated by 
      the switched MR gradients. Several methods have been proposed to remove these 
      distortions by subtraction of averaged artifact templates from the ongoing EEG. 
      Here, we present a modification of this approach which accounts for head 
      movements to improve the extracted template. Using the fMRI analysis package 
      statistical parametric mapping (SPM; FIL London) the head displacement is 
      determined at each half fMRI-volume. The basic idea is to apply a moving average 
      algorithm for template extraction but to include only epochs that were obtained 
      at the same head position as the artefact to be removed. This approach was 
      derived from phantom EEG measurements demonstrating substantial variations of the 
      artefact waveform in response to movements of the phantom in the MRI magnet. To 
      further reduce the residual noise, we applied a resampling algorithm which aligns 
      the EEG samples in a strict adaptive manner to the fMRI timing. Finally, we 
      propose a new algorithm to suppress residual artifacts such as those occasionally 
      observed in case of brief strong movements, which are not reflected by the 
      movement indicator because of the limited temporal resolution of the fMRI 
      sequence. On the basis of EEG recordings of six subjects these measures combined 
      reduce the residual artefact activity quantified in terms of the spectral power 
      at the gradient repetition rate and its harmonics by roughly 20 to 50% (depending 
      on the amount of movement) predominantly in frequencies beyond 30 Hz.

TI  - A method for accurate group difference detection by constraining the mixing 
      coefficients in an ICA framework.
PG  - 2953-70
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20721 [doi]
AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising method that is increasingly 
      used to analyze brain imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI), structural MRI, and electroencephalography and has also proved useful for 
      group comparison, e.g., differentiating healthy controls from patients. An 
      advantage of ICA is its ability to identify components that are mixed in an 
      unknown manner. However, ICA is not necessarily robust and optimal in identifying 
      between-group effects, especially in highly noisy situations. Here, we propose a 
      modified ICA framework for multigroup data analysis that incorporates prior 
      information regarding group membership as a constraint into the mixing 
      coefficients. Our approach, called coefficient-constrained ICA (CC-ICA), 
      prioritizes identification of components that show a significant group 
      difference. The performance of CC-ICA via synthetic and hybrid data simulations 
      is evaluated under different hypothesis testing assumptions and signal to noise 
      ratios (SNRs). Group analysis is also conducted on real multitask fMRI data. 
      Results show that CC-ICA improves the estimation accuracy of the independent 
      components greatly, especially those that have different patterns for different 
      groups (e.g., patients vs. controls); In addition, it enhances the data 
      extraction sensitivity to group differences by ranking components with P value or 
      J-divergence more consistently with the ground truth. The proposed algorithm 
      performs quite well for both group-difference detection and multitask fMRI data 
      fusion, which may prove especially important for the identification of relevant 
      disease biomarkers.

TI  - Extracting complexity waveforms from one-dimensional signals.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/1753-4631-3-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonlinear methods provide a direct way of estimating complexity of 
      one-dimensional sampled signals through calculation of Higuchi's fractal 
      dimension (1<FD<2). In most cases the signal is treated as being characterized by 
      one value of FD and consequently analyzed as one epoch or, if divided into more 
      epochs, often only mean and standard deviation of epoch FD are calculated. If its 
      complexity variation (or running fractal dimension), FD(t), is to be extracted, a 
      moving window (epoch) approach is needed. However, due to low-pass filtering 
      properties of moving windows, short epochs are preferred. Since Higuchi's method 
      is based on consecutive reduction of signal sampling frequency, it is not 
      suitable for estimating FD of very short epochs (N < 100 samples). RESULTS: In 
      this work we propose a new and simple way to estimate FD for N < 100 by 
      introducing 'normalized length density' of a signal epoch,where yn(i) represents 
      the ith signal sample after amplitude normalization. The actual calculation of 
      signal FD is based on construction of a monotonic calibration curve, FD = f(NLD), 
      on a set of Weierstrass functions, for which FD values are given theoretically. 
      The two existing methods, Higuchi's and consecutive differences, applied 
      simultaneously on signals with constant FD (white noise and Brownian motion), 
      showed that standard deviation of calculated window FD (FDw) increased sharply as 
      the epoch became shorter. However, in case of the new NLD method a considerably 
      lower scattering was obtained, especially for N < 30, at the expense of some 
      lower accuracy in calculating average FDw. Consequently, more accurate 
      reconstruction of FD waveforms was obtained when synthetic signals were analyzed, 
      containig short alternating epochs of two or three different FD values. 
      Additionally, scatter plots of FDw of an occipital human EEG signal for 10 sample 
      epochs demontrated that Higuchi's estimations for some epochs exceeded the 
      theoretical FD limits, while NLD-derived values did not. CONCLUSION: The 
      presented approach was more accurate than the existing two methods in FD(t) 
      extraction for very short epochs and could be used in physiological signals when 
      FD is expected to change abruptly, such as short phasic phenomena or transient 
      artefacts, as well as in other fields of science.

TI  - GENERALIZED SIDELOBE CANCELLER FOR MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY ARRAYS.
PG  - 149-152
AB  - In the last decade, large arrays of sensors for magnetoencephalography (MEG) (and 
      electroencephalography (EEG)) have become more commonplace, allowing new 
      opportunities for the application of beamforming techniques to the joint problems 
      of signal estimation and noise reduction. We introduce a new approach to noise 
      cancellation, the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC), itself an alternative to 
      the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithm. The GSC framework 
      naturally fits within the other noise reduction techniques that employ real or 
      virtual reference arrays. Using expository human subject data with strong 
      environmental and biological artifacts, we demonstrate a straightforward sequence 
      of steps for practical noise filtering, applicable to any large array sensor 
      design.

TI  - A multistage system for the automated detection of epileptic seizures in neonatal 
      electroencephalography.
PG  - 218-26
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e3181b2f29d [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the design and test results of a three-stage automated 
      system for neonatal EEG seizure detection. Stage I of the system is the initial 
      detection stage and identifies overlapping 5-second segments of suspected seizure 
      activity in each EEG channel. In stage II, the detected segments from stage I are 
      spatiotemporally clustered to produce multichannel candidate seizures. In stage 
      III, the candidate seizures are processed further using measures of quality and 
      context-based rules to eliminate false candidates. False candidates because of 
      artifacts and commonly occurring EEG background patterns such as bifrontal delta 
      activity are also rejected. Seizures at least 10 seconds in duration are 
      considered for reporting results. The testing data consisted of recordings of 28 
      seizure subjects (34 hours of data) and 48 nonseizure subjects (87 hours of data) 
      obtained in the neonatal intensive care unit. The data were not edited to remove 
      artifacts and were identical in every way to data normally processed visually. 
      The system was able to detect seizures of widely varying morphology with an 
      average detection sensitivity of almost 80% and a subject sensitivity of 96%, in 
      comparison with a team of clinical neurophysiologists who had scored the same 
      recordings. The average false detection rate obtained in nonseizure subjects was 
      0.74 per hour.

TI  - Removing muscle and eye artifacts using blind source separation techniques in 
      ictal EEG source imaging.
PG  - 1262-72
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.05.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The contamination of muscle and eye artifacts during an ictal period 
      of the EEG significantly distorts source estimation algorithms. Recent blind 
      source separation (BSS) techniques based on canonical correlation (BSS-CCA) and 
      independent component analysis with spatial constraints (SCICA) have shown much 
      promise in the removal of these artifacts. In this study we want to use BSS-CCA 
      and SCICA as a preprocessing step before the source estimation during the ictal 
      period. METHODS: Both the contaminated and cleaned ictal EEG were subjected to 
      the RAP-MUSIC algorithm. This is a multiple dipole source estimation technique 
      based on the separation of the EEG in signal and noise subspace. The source 
      estimates were compared with the subtracted ictal SPECT (iSPECT) coregistered to 
      magnetic resonance imaging (SISCOM) by means of the euclidean distance between 
      the iSPECT activations and the dipole location estimates. SISCOM results in an 
      image denoting the ictal onset zone with a propagation. RESULTS: We applied the 
      artifact removal and the source estimation on 8 patients. Qualitatively, we can 
      see that 5 out of 8 patients show an improvement of the dipoles. The dipoles are 
      nearer to or have tighter clusters near the iSPECT activation. From the median of 
      the distance measure, we could appreciate that 5 out of 8 patients show 
      improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that BSS-CCA and SCICA can be applied 
      to remove artifacts, but the results should be interpreted with care. The results 
      of the source estimation can be misleading due to excessive noise or modeling 
      errors. Therefore, the accuracy of the source estimation can be increased by 
      preprocessing the ictal EEG segment by BSS-CCA and SCICA. SIGNIFICANCE: This is a 
      pilot study where EEG source localization in the presurgical evaluation can be 
      made more reliable, if preprocessing techniques such as BSS-CCA and SCICA are 
      used prior to EEG source analysis on ictal episodes.

PG  - 708-16
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.028 [doi]
AB  - Both invasive and non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from the 
      human brain have an increasingly important role in neuroscience research and are 
      candidate modalities for medical brain-machine interfacing. It is often assumed 
      that the major artifacts that compromise non-invasive EEG, such as caused by 
      blinks and eye movement, are absent in invasive EEG recordings. Quantitative 
      investigations on the signal quality of simultaneously recorded invasive and 
      non-invasive EEG in terms of artifact contamination are, however, lacking. Here 
      we compared blink related artifacts in non-invasive and invasive EEG, 
      simultaneously recorded from prefrontal and motor cortical regions using an 
      approach suitable for detection of small artifact contamination. As expected, we 
      find blinks to cause pronounced artifacts in non-invasive EEG both above 
      prefrontal and motor cortical regions. Unexpectedly, significant blink related 
      artifacts were also found in the invasive recordings, in particular in the 
      prefrontal region. Computing a ratio of artifact amplitude to the amplitude of 
      ongoing brain activity, we find that the signal quality of invasive EEG is 20 to 
      above 100 times better than that of simultaneously obtained non-invasive EEG. 
      Thus, while our findings indicate that ocular artifacts do exist in invasive 
      recordings, they also highlight the much better signal quality of invasive 
      compared to non-invasive EEG data. Our findings suggest that blinks should be 
      taken into account in the experimental design of ECoG studies, particularly when 
      event related potentials in fronto-anterior brain regions are analyzed. Moreover, 
      our results encourage the application of techniques for reducing ocular artifacts 
      to further optimize the signal quality of invasive EEG.

TI  - Independent component analysis as a model-free approach for the detection of BOLD 
      changes related to epileptic spikes: a simulation study.
PG  - 2021-31
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20647 [doi]
AB  - EEG-fMRI in epileptic patients is commonly analyzed using the general linear 
      model (GLM), which assumes a known hemodynamic response function (HRF) to 
      epileptic spikes in the EEG. In contrast, independent component analysis (ICA) 
      can extract Blood-Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) responses without imposing 
      constraints on the HRF. This technique was evaluated on data generated by 
      superimposing artificial responses on real background fMRI signals. Simulations 
      were run using a wide range of EEG spiking rates, HRF amplitudes, and activation 
      regions. The data were decomposed by spatial ICA into independent components. A 
      deconvolution method then identified component time courses significantly related 
      to the simulated spikes, without constraining the shape of the HRF. Components 
      matching the simulated activation regions ("concordant components") were found in 
      84.4% of simulations, while components at discordant locations were found in 
      12.2% of simulations. These false activations were often related to large 
      artifacts that coincidentally occurred simultaneously with some of the random 
      simulated spikes. The performance of the method depended closely on the 
      simulation parameters; when the number of spikes was low, concordant components 
      could only be identified when HRF amplitudes were large. Although ICA did not 
      depend on the shape of the HRF, data processed with the GLM did not reveal the 
      appropriate activation region when the HRF varied slightly from the canonical 
      shape used in the model. ICA may thus be able to extract BOLD responses from 
      EEG-fMRI data in epileptic patients, in a way that is robust to uncertainty and 
      variability in the shape of the HRF.

TI  - Graphical modelling for brain connectivity via partial coherence.
PG  - 374-83
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.04.003 [doi]
AB  - Spectral and coherence methodologies are ubiquitous for the analysis of multiple 
      time series. Partial coherence analysis may be used to try to determine graphical 
      models for brain functional connectivity. The outcome of such an analysis may be 
      considerably influenced by factors such as the degree of spectral smoothing, line 
      and interference removal, matrix inversion stabilization and the suppression of 
      effects caused by side-lobe leakage, the combination of results from different 
      epochs and people, and multiple hypothesis testing. This paper examines each of 
      these steps in turn and provides a possible path which produces relatively 
      'clean' connectivity plots. In particular we show how spectral matrix diagonal 
      up-weighting can simultaneously stabilize spectral matrix inversion and reduce 
      effects caused by side-lobe leakage, and use the stepdown multiple hypothesis 
      test procedure to help formulate an interaction strength.

TI  - A Highly Backdrivable, Lightweight Knee Actuator for Investigating Gait in 
      Stroke.
PG  - 539-548
AB  - Many of those who survive a stroke develop a gait disability known as stiff-knee 
      gait (SKG). Characterized by reduced knee flexion angle during swing, people with 
      SKG walk with poor energy efficiency and asymmetry due to the compensatory 
      mechanisms required to clear the foot. Previous modeling studies have shown that 
      knee flexion activity directly before the foot leaves the ground, and this should 
      result in improved knee flexion angle during swing. The goal of this research is 
      to physically test this hypothesis using robotic intervention. We developed a 
      device that is capable of assisting knee flexion torque before swing but feels 
      imperceptible (transparent) for the rest of the gait cycle. This device uses 
      sheathed Bowden cable to control the deflection of a compliant torsional spring 
      in a configuration known as a Series Elastic Remote Knee Actuator (SERKA). In 
      this investigation, we describe the design and evaluation of SERKA, which 
      includes a pilot experiment on stroke subjects. SERKA could supply a substantial 
      torque (12 N· m) in less than 20 ms, with a maximum torque of 41 N·m. The device 
      resisted knee flexion imperceptibly when desired, at less than 1 N·m rms torque 
      during normal gait. With the remote location of the actuator, the user 
      experiences a mass of only 1.2 kg on the knee. We found that the device was 
      capable of increasing both peak knee flexion angle and velocity during gait in 
      stroke subjects. Thus, the SERKA is a valid experimental device that selectively 
      alters knee kinetics and kinematics in gait after stroke.

PG  - 7-12
LID - 10.1007/s10548-009-0079-4 [doi]
AB  - Muscle or electromyogenic (EMG) artifact poses a serious risk to inferential 
      validity for any electroencephalography (EEG) investigation in the 
      frequency-domain owing to its high amplitude, broad spectrum, and sensitivity to 
      psychological processes of interest. Even weak EMG is detectable across the scalp 
      in frequencies as low as the alpha band. Given these hazards, there is 
      substantial interest in developing EMG correction tools. Unfortunately, most 
      published techniques are subjected to only modest validation attempts, rendering 
      their utility questionable. We review recent work by our laboratory 
      quantitatively investigating the validity of two popular EMG correction 
      techniques, one using the general linear model (GLM), the other using temporal 
      independent component analysis (ICA). We show that intra-individual GLM-based 
      methods represent a sensitive and specific tool for correcting on-going or 
      induced, but not evoked (phase-locked) or source-localized, spectral changes. 
      Preliminary work with ICA shows that it may not represent a panacea for EMG 
      contamination, although further scrutiny is strongly warranted. We conclude by 
      describing emerging methodological trends in this area that are likely to have 
      substantial benefits for basic and applied EEG research.

PG  - 578-92

AB  - EEG and EEG source-estimation are susceptible to electromyographic artifacts 
      (EMG) generated by the cranial muscles. EMG can mask genuine effects or 
      masquerade as a legitimate effect-even in low frequencies, such as alpha (8-13 
      Hz). Although regression-based correction has been used previously, only cursory 
      attempts at validation exist, and the utility for source-localized data is 
      unknown. To address this, EEG was recorded from 17 participants while neurogenic 
      and myogenic activity were factorially varied. We assessed the sensitivity and 
      specificity of four regression-based techniques: between-subjects, 
      between-subjects using difference-scores, within-subjects condition-wise, and 
      within-subject epoch-wise on the scalp and in data modeled using the LORETA 
      algorithm. Although within-subject epoch-wise showed superior performance on the 
      scalp, no technique succeeded in the source-space. Aside from validating the 
      novel epoch-wise methods on the scalp, we highlight methods requiring further 
      development.

PG  - 1524-34
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20627 [doi]
AB  - Magnetic interference signals often hamper analysis of magnetoencephalographic 
      (MEG) measurements. Artifact sources in the proximity of the sensors cause strong 
      and spatially complex signals that are particularly challenging for the existing 
      interference-suppression methods. Here we demonstrate the performance of the 
      temporally extended signal space separation method (tSSS) in removing strong 
      interference caused by external and nearby sources on auditory-evoked magnetic 
      fields-the sources of which are well established. The MEG signals were 
      contaminated by normal environmental interference, by artificially produced 
      additional external interference, and by nearby artifacts produced by a piece of 
      magnetized wire in the subject's lip. After tSSS processing, even the 
      single-trial auditory responses had a good-enough signal-to-noise ratio for 
      detailed waveform and source analysis. Waveforms and source locations of the 
      tSSS-reconstructed data were in good agreement with the responses from the 
      control condition without extra interference. Our results demonstrate that tSSS 
      is a robust and efficient method for removing a wide range of different types of 
      interference signals in neuromagnetic multichannel measurements.

AB  - Ocular artifacts in EEG signals affect the interpretation of clinical study 
      results. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of automatic ocular 
      filtering procedures in the conclusions drawn from a pharmaco-EEG trial. 
      Regression analysis, gold standard, and blind source separation (BSS), Second 
      Order Blind Identification algorithm, ocular filtering procedures were compared 
      using time, frequency, topographic and tomographic brain mapping approaches and 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships. Data consisted of EEGs 
      obtained from 20 volunteers who received single oral doses of haloperidol 3 mg, 
      risperidone 1 mg, olanzapine 5 mg and placebo in a randomized cross-over 
      double-blind design. Although the BSS-based technique preserved brain activity 
      more than regression analysis in anterior leads, in general, topographic 
      significance probability maps globally showed similar results with both methods 
      for most spectral variables. However, different results were obtained when using 
      whole multi-channel information for studying drug effects in the brain: (i) 
      higher correlations between PK and PD time courses showing that BSS allowed 
      estimation of spectral variables more accurately related to drug effects and (ii) 
      larger and more symmetric drug related tomographic LORETA maps showing that BSS 
      led to results that were more neurophysiopharmacologically sound. Definitely, the 
      BSS-based procedure is an effective and efficient preprocessing method to remove 
      ocular artifacts from EEG data. The selection of the ocular filtering procedure 
      could determine different results whose impact depends on the evaluating tool 
      applied to analyze the pharmaco-EEG data.

TI  - Fast optical signal not detected in awake behaving monkeys.
PG  - 410-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.12.014 [doi]
AB  - While the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral 
      hemodynamic evoked responses (slow optical signal) is well established, its 
      ability to measure non-invasively the 'fast optical signal' is still 
      controversial. Here, we aim to determine the feasibility of performing NIRS 
      measurements of the 'fast optical signal' or Event-Related Optical Signals (EROS) 
      under optimal experimental conditions in awake behaving macaque monkeys. These 
      monkeys were implanted with a 'recording well' to expose the dura above the 
      primary visual cortex (V1). A custom-made optical probe was inserted and fixed 
      into the well. The close proximity of the probe to the brain maximized the 
      sensitivity to changes in optical properties in the cortex. Motion artifacts were 
      minimized by physical restraint of the head. Full-field contrast-reversing 
      checkerboard stimuli were presented to monkeys trained to perform a visual 
      fixation task. In separate sessions, two NIRS systems (CW4 and ISS FD oximeter), 
      which previously showed the ability to measure the fast signal in human, were 
      used. In some sessions EEG was acquired simultaneously with the optical signal. 
      The increased sensitivity to cortical optical changes with our experimental setup 
      was quantified with 3D Monte Carlo simulations on a segmented MRI monkey head. 
      Averages of thousands of stimuli in the same animal, or grand averages across the 
      two animals and across repeated sessions, did not lead to detection of the fast 
      optical signal using either amplitude or phase of the optical signal. Hemodynamic 
      responses and visual evoked potentials were instead always detected with single 
      trials or averages of a few stimuli. Based on these negative results, despite the 
      optimal experimental conditions, we doubt the usefulness of non-invasive fast 
      optical signal measurements with NIRS.

PG  - 979-86

AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded in epileptic 
      patients with clinical intracranial EEG. HFOs have been associated with seizure 
      genesis because they occur in the seizure focus and during seizure onset. HFOs 
      are also found interictally, partly co-occurring with epileptic spikes. We 
      studied how HFOs are influenced by antiepileptic medication and seizure 
      occurrence, to improve understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical meaning 
      of HFOs. METHODS: Intracerebral depth EEG was partly sampled at 2,000 Hz in 42 
      patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with five or more usable 
      nights of recording were selected. A sample of slow-wave sleep from each night 
      was analyzed, and HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) and spikes 
      were identified on all artifact-free channels. The HFOs and spikes were compared 
      before and after seizures with stable medication dose and during medication 
      reduction with no intervening seizures. RESULTS: Twelve patients with five to 
      eight nights were included. After seizures, there was an increase in spikes, 
      whereas HFO rates remained the same. Medication reduction was followed by an 
      increase in HFO rates and mean duration. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to spikes, 
      high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) do not increase after seizures, but do so 
      after medication reduction, similarly to seizures. This implies that spikes and 
      HFOs have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and that HFOs are more tightly 
      linked to seizures than spikes. HFOs seem to play an important role in seizure 
      genesis and can be a useful clinical marker for disease activity.

TI  - A simple quantitative method for analyzing electrographic status epilepticus in 
      rats.
PG  - 1660-70
LID - 10.1152/jn.91062.2008 [doi]
AB  - Electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) is a medical emergency consisting of 
      repetitive seizures and may result in death or severe brain damage. Epilepsy can 
      develop following ESE. The properties of ESE (e.g., duration and intensity) are 
      variable, as are the effects of putative therapeutic treatments. Therefore a 
      straightforward method to quantify different components of ESE would be 
      beneficial for both researchers and clinicians. A frequency range close to the 
      gamma band was selected for extraction of seizure-related activity from the EEG. 
      This filtering strategy reduced motion artifacts and other noise sources in the 
      electrophysiological recordings, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the 
      EEG spike activity. EEG spiking was quantified using an energy operator and 
      modeled by an eighth-order polynomial. In a benzodiazepine-resistant rat model of 
      pilocarpine-induced ESE, the efficacy of various pharmaceutical agents at 
      suppressing ESE was analyzed with this and other methods on data collected for < 
      or =24 h after ESE induction. This approach allows for the objective, 
      quantitative, and rapid assessment of the effects of both short- and long-lasting 
      pharmacological manipulations on ESE and other forms of prolonged repetitive 
      electrical activity.

PG  - 200-4
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2008.2005952 [doi]
AB  - We present a nonlinear unmixing approach for extracting the ballistocardiogram 
      (BCG) from EEG recorded in an MR scanner during simultaneous acquisition of 
      functional MRI (fMRI). First, an overcomplete basis is identified in the EEG 
      based on a custom multipath EEG electrode cap. Next, the overcomplete basis is 
      used to infer non-Kirchhoffian latent variables that are not consistent with a 
      conservative electric field. Neural activity is strictly Kirchhoffian while the 
      BCG artifact is not, and the representation can hence be used to remove the 
      artifacts from the data in a way that does not attenuate the neural signals 
      needed for optimal single-trial classification performance. We compare our method 
      to more standard methods for BCG removal, namely independent component analysis 
      and optimal basis sets, by looking at single-trial classification performance for 
      an auditory oddball experiment. We show that our overcomplete representation 
      method for removing BCG artifacts results in better single-trial classification 
      performance compared to the conventional approaches, indicating that the derived 
      neural activity in this representation retains the complex information in the 
      trial-to-trial variability.

TI  - Interpretation of the auto-mutual information rate of decrease in the context of 
      biomedical signal analysis. Application to electroencephalogram recordings.
PG  - 187-99
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/30/2/006 [doi]
AB  - The mutual information (MI) is a measure of both linear and nonlinear 
      dependences. It can be applied to a time series and a time-delayed version of the 
      same sequence to compute the auto-mutual information function (AMIF). Moreover, 
      the AMIF rate of decrease (AMIFRD) with increasing time delay in a signal is 
      correlated with its entropy and has been used to characterize biomedical data. In 
      this paper, we aimed at gaining insight into the dependence of the AMIFRD on 
      several signal processing concepts and at illustrating its application to 
      biomedical time series analysis. Thus, we have analysed a set of synthetic 
      sequences with the AMIFRD. The results show that the AMIF decreases more quickly 
      as bandwidth increases and that the AMIFRD becomes more negative as there is more 
      white noise contaminating the time series. Additionally, this metric detected 
      changes in the nonlinear dynamics of a signal. Finally, in order to illustrate 
      the analysis of real biomedical signals with the AMIFRD, this metric was applied 
      to electroencephalogram (EEG) signals acquired with eyes open and closed and to 
      ictal and non-ictal intracranial EEG recordings.

AB  - Determining the function of the brain is one of the important goals of 
      neuroscience and its associated clinical disciplines of neurology, psychiatry, 
      neurosurgery, and psychology. Functional brain mapping or neuroimaging is a set 
      of imaging modalities that permits localization and visualization of brain 
      activity. Neuroimaging has the potential of allowing observation of the function 
      of the human nervous system, and to aid in clinical diagnosis and monitor ongoing 
      neural function. There are at least a dozen of neuroimaging approaches that allow 
      monitoring of neural functions. These approaches differ very widely in their 
      spatial and temporal resolution, level of invasiveness, and costs. They can be 
      divided into two groups: (1) ones that measure neural activity (emission of 
      electromagnetic fields) directly and (2) ones that rely on indirect measurements 
      of metabolic signals. The techniques that fall into the first group typically are 
      not used for neuroimaging because they are either very invasive, for example, 
      electrophysiology, or provide very low spatial resolution, for example, 
      electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). The other group 
      consists of a variety of techniques that either use radioactive labels such as 
      positron emission tomography (PET) or use signals of endogenous nature and 
      include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and optical imaging of 
      intrinsic signals (ISOI). The latter group is particularly attractive for brain 
      mapping because it provides moderate to high spatial resolution and does not 
      require introduction of labels. What is characteristic of this group is that it 
      measures hemodynamic signals, that is, the signals related to changes in blood 
      oxygenation, blood volume, and blood flow rate [1,2]. As a consequence the 
      measured signals are contaminated by the cardiovascular artifacts such as heart 
      beat, respiration, and vasomotion [3]. The conventional imaging protocols are 
      implemented in the time domain where randomized stimulus presentation is followed 
      by data collection and averaging. As the result the evoked activity cannot be 
      straightforwardly disassociated from the noise. The standard approach to noise 
      reduction requires massive averaging, which in turn leads to long experimental 
      runs. Recently, we developed a rather general methodology that effectively 
      removes the physiological noise [4]. A simple observation that the components of 
      the noise are cyclic suggested implementation of the imaging protocol in the 
      frequency domain instead of the time domain. The noise components appear 
      localized in rather narrow frequency bands in the frequency domain, thus periodic 
      stimulation at a frequency far from these bands will evoke a periodic response 
      which is nearly free of the cardiovascular contaminations. Finally, a 
      straightforward Fourier analysis extracts the parameters of the evoked response. 
      In this chapter we present the basics of the Fourier approach, which can be 
      applied to any imaging modality that suffers from cyclic contaminations, and 
      demonstrate its use for rapid acquisition of cortical maps by optical imaging of 
      intrinsic signals.

TI  - Application of independent component analysis for the data mining of simultaneous 
      Eeg-fMRI: preliminary experience on sleep onset.
PG  - 1118-36
AB  - The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional MRI 
      (fMRI) signals is potentially advantageous because of the superior resolution 
      that is achieved in both the temporal and spatial domains, respectively. However, 
      ballistocardiographic artifacts along with ocular artifacts are a major obstacle 
      for the detection of the EEG signatures of interest. Since the sources 
      corresponding to these artifacts are independent from those producing the EEG 
      signatures, we applied the Infomax-based independent component analysis (ICA) 
      technique to separate the EEG signatures from the artifacts. The isolated EEG 
      signatures were further utilized to model the canonical hemodynamic response 
      functions (HRFs). Subsequently, the brain areas from which these EEG signatures 
      originated were identified as locales of activation patterns from the analysis of 
      fMRI data. Upon the identification and subsequent evaluation of brain areas 
      generating interictal epileptic discharge (IED) spikes from an epileptic subject, 
      the presented method was successfully applied to detect the theta and alpha 
      rhythms that are sleep onset-related EEG signatures along with the subsequent 
      neural circuitries from a sleep-deprived volunteer. These results suggest that 
      the ICA technique may be useful for the preprocessing of simultaneous EEG-fMRI 
      acquisitions, especially when a reference paradigm is unavailable.

TI  - Permutation entropy of the electroencephalogram: a measure of anaesthetic drug 
      effect.
PG  - 810-21
LID - 10.1093/bja/aen290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It would be useful to have an open-source electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) index of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-ergic anaesthetic drug effect that 
      is resistant to eye-blink artifact, responds rapidly to changes in EEG pattern, 
      and can be linked to underlying neurophysiological and neuropharmacological 
      mechanisms that control the conscious state. METHODS: The EEG waveform can be 
      described as a sequence of ordinal patterns. The permutation entropy (PE) 
      describes the relative occurrence of each of these patterns. It is high ( 
      approximately 1.0) when the signal has predominantly high frequencies and low ( 
      approximately 0.4) when the signal consists of only low frequencies. The response 
      of the PE to various computer-generated EEG-like waveforms was assessed. A 
      composite PE index (CPEI) was developed, which was the sum of two simple PEs and 
      included a small measurement-noise threshold (0.5 microV). We also applied the 
      CPEI to two small pilot EEG data sets from patients receiving sevoflurane (n=21) 
      or propofol (n=9) anaesthesia. RESULTS: With minimal pre-processing or artifact 
      rejection, the CPEI reliably tracked the anaesthetic-related EEG changes, namely 
      loss of high frequencies, spindle-like waves, and delta waves. Using NONMEM, it 
      was possible to construct adequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models from 
      the data. The CPEI was comparable with models derived using the bispectral index 
      [BIS R(2)=0.88 (0.08) vs CPEI R(2)=0.91 (0.06) for the propofol data] and 
      M-entropy indices [M-entropy R(2)=0.91 (0.06) vs CPEI R(2)=0.87 (0.09) for the 
      sevoflurane data]. CONCLUSIONS: PE of the EEG shows promise as a simple measure 
      of GABAergic anaesthetic drug effect.

TI  - Ultrahigh speed spectral / Fourier domain OCT ophthalmic imaging at 70,000 to 
      312,500 axial scans per second.
PG  - 15149-69
AB  - We demonstrate ultrahigh speed spectral / Fourier domain optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) using an ultrahigh speed CMOS line scan camera at rates of 
      70,000 - 312,500 axial scans per second. Several design configurations are 
      characterized to illustrate trade-offs between acquisition speed, resolution, 
      imaging range, sensitivity and sensitivity roll-off performance. Ultrahigh 
      resolution OCT with 2.5 - 3.0 micron axial image resolution is demonstrated at 
      approximately 100,000 axial scans per second. A high resolution spectrometer 
      design improves sensitivity roll-off and imaging range performance, trading off 
      imaging speed to 70,000 axial scans per second. Ultrahigh speed imaging at 
      >300,000 axial scans per second with standard image resolution is also 
      demonstrated. Ophthalmic OCT imaging of the normal human retina is investigated. 
      The high acquisition speeds enable dense raster scanning to acquire densely 
      sampled volumetric three dimensional OCT (3D-OCT) data sets of the macula and 
      optic disc with minimal motion artifacts. Imaging with approximately 8 - 9 micron 
      axial resolution at 250,000 axial scans per second, a 512 x 512 x 400 voxel 
      volumetric 3D-OCT data set can be acquired in only approximately 1.3 seconds. 
      Orthogonal registration scans are used to register OCT raster scans and remove 
      residual axial eye motion, resulting in 3D-OCT data sets which preserve retinal 
      topography. Rapid repetitive imaging over small volumes can visualize small 
      retinal features without motion induced distortions and enables volume 
      registration to remove eye motion. Cone photoreceptors in some regions of the 
      retina can be visualized without adaptive optics or active eye tracking. Rapid 
      repetitive imaging of 3D volumes also provides dynamic volumetric information 
      (4D-OCT) which is shown to enhance visualization of retinal capillaries and 
      should enable functional imaging. Improvements in the speed and performance of 
      3D-OCT volumetric imaging promise to enable earlier diagnosis and improved 
      monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy in ophthalmology, as 
      well as have a wide range of research and clinical applications in other areas.

TI  - Testing for nested oscillation.
PG  - 50-61
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2008.06.035 [doi]
AB  - Nested oscillation occurs when the amplitude of a faster rhythm is coupled to the 
      phase of a slower rhythm. It has been proposed to underlie the discrete nature of 
      perception and the capacity of working memory and is a phenomenon observable in 
      human brain imaging data. This paper compares three published methods for 
      detecting nested oscillation and a fourth method proposed in this paper. These 
      are: (i) the modulation index, (ii) the phase-locking value (PLV), (iii) the 
      envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) and (iv) a general linear model (GLM) 
      measure derived from ESC. We applied the methods to electrocorticographic (ECoG) 
      data recorded during a working-memory task and to data from a simulated 
      hippocampal interneuron network. Further simulations were then made to address 
      the dependence of each measure on signal to noise level, coupling phase, epoch 
      length, sample rate, signal nonstationarity, and multi-phasic coupling. Our 
      overall conclusion is that the GLM measure is the best all-round approach for 
      detecting nested oscillation.

TI  - Removal of the eye-blink artifacts from EEGs via STF-TS modeling and robust 
      minimum variance beamforming.
PG  - 2221-31
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2008.919847 [doi]
AB  - A novel scheme for the removal of eye-blink (EB) artifacts from 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on a novel space-time-frequency (STF) 
      model of EEGs and robust minimum variance beamformer (RMVB) is proposed. In this 
      method, in order to remove the artifact, the RMVB is provided with a priori 
      information, namely, an estimation of the steering vector corresponding to the 
      point source EB artifact. The artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently 
      reconstructed by deflation. The a priori knowledge, the vector corresponding to 
      the spatial distribution of the EB factor, is identified using the STF model of 
      EEGs, provided by the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method. In order to 
      reduce the computational complexity present in the estimation of the STF model 
      using the three-way PARAFAC, the time domain is subdivided into a number of 
      segments, and a four-way array is then set to estimate the STF-time/segment (TS) 
      model of the data using the four-way PARAFAC. The correct number of the factors 
      of the STF model is effectively estimated by using a novel core consistency 
      diagnostic- (CORCONDIA-) based measure. Subsequently, the STF-TS model is shown 
      to closely approximate the classic STF model, with significantly lower 
      computational cost. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively 
      identifies and removes the EB artifact from raw EEG measurements.

TI  - Noise reduction in rhythmic and multitrial biosignals with applications to 
      event-related potentials.
PG  - 1809-21
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2008.919851 [doi]
AB  - A new noise reduction algorithm is presented for signals displaying repeated 
      patterns or multiple trials. Each pattern is stored in a matrix, forming a set of 
      events, which is termed multievent signal. Each event is considered as an affine 
      transform of a basic template signal that allows for time scaling and shifting. 
      Wavelet transforms, decimated and undecimated, are applied to each event. Noise 
      reduction on the set of coefficients of the transformed events is applied using 
      either wavelet denoising or principal component analysis (PCA) noise reduction 
      methodologies. The method does not require any manual selection of coefficients. 
      Nonstationary multievent synthetic signals are employed to demonstrate the 
      performance of the method using normalized mean square error against classical 
      wavelet and PCA based algorithms. The new method shows a significant improvement 
      in low SNRs (typically 0 dB). On the experimental side, evoked potentials in a 
      visual oddball paradigm are used. The reduced-noise visual oddball event-related 
      potentials reveal gradual changes in morphology from trial to trial (especially 
      for N1-P2 and N2-P3 waves at Fz), which can be hypothetically linked to attention 
      or decision processes. The new noise reduction method is, thus, shown to be 
      particularly suited for recovering single-event features in nonstationary low SNR 
      multievent contexts.

TI  - Error-related EEG potentials generated during simulated brain-computer 
      interaction.
PG  - 923-9
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2007.908083 [doi]
AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are prone to errors in the recognition of 
      subject's intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in 
      a verification procedure directly based on the presence of error-related 
      potentials (ErrP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded right after the 
      occurrence of an error. Several studies show the presence of ErrP in typical 
      choice reaction tasks. However, in the context of a BCI, the central question is: 
      "Are ErrP also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the 
      recognition of the subject's intent?"; We have thus explored whether ErrP also 
      follow a feedback indicating incorrect responses of the simulated BCI interface. 
      Five healthy volunteer subjects participated in a new human-robot interaction 
      experiment, which seem to confirm the previously reported presence of a new kind 
      of ErrP. However, in order to exploit these ErrP, we need to detect them in each 
      single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the 
      response of the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and 
      erroneous single trials of 83.5% and 79.2%, respectively, using a classifier 
      built with data recorded up to three months earlier.

TI  - MRI-based correction for partial-volume effect improves detectability of 
      intractable epileptogenic foci on 123I-iomazenil brain SPECT images.
PG  - 383-9
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.107.046136 [doi]
AB  - (123)I-Iomazenil brain SPECT has been used for the detection of epileptogenic 
      foci, especially when surgical intervention is considered. Although epileptogenic 
      foci exhibit a decrease in (123)I-iomazenil accumulation, normal cerebral 
      cortices often exhibit similar findings because of thin cortical ribbons, gray 
      matter atrophy, or pathologic brain structures. In the present study, we created 
      (123)I-iomazenil SPECT images corrected for gray matter volume using MRI and 
      tested whether the detectability of the epileptogenic foci improved. METHODS: 
      Seven patients (1 male patient and 6 female patients; mean age +/- SD, 34 +/- 17 
      y) with intractable epilepsy were surgically treated by resecting the cerebral 
      cortex after surface electroencephalography. Histopathologic examination of the 
      resected specimens and a good outcome after surgery indicated that the resected 
      lesions were epileptogenic foci. These patients underwent (123)I-iomazenil SPECT 
      and 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI examinations before their operations. Each 
      SPECT image was coregistered to the corresponding MR image, and its 
      partial-volume effect (PVE) was corrected on a voxel-by-voxel basis with a 
      smoothed gray matter distribution image. Four nuclear medicine physicians 
      visually evaluated the (123)I-iomazenil SPECT images with and without the PVE 
      correction. The SPECT count ratio of the suspected focus to the contralateral 
      cerebral cortex was evaluated as an asymmetry index (%) based on the volume of 
      interest. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of focus detection 
      by visual assessment were higher after PVE correction (88%, 99%, and 98%, 
      respectively) than before correction (50%, 92%, and 87%, respectively). The mean 
      asymmetry index for the surgically resected lesions was significantly higher on 
      the PVE-corrected SPECT images (22%) than on the PVE-uncorrected ones (16%) (P = 
      0.006). CONCLUSION: MRI-based PVE correction for (123)I-iomazenil brain SPECT 
      improves the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of cortical 
      epileptogenic foci in patients with intractable epilepsy.

TI  - A comparative study of automatic techniques for ocular artifact reduction in 
      spontaneous EEG signals based on clinical target variables: a simulation case.
PG  - 348-60
LID - 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.12.001 [doi]
AB  - Eye movement artifacts represent a critical issue for quantitative 
      electroencephalography (EEG) analysis and a number of mathematical approaches 
      have been proposed to reduce their contribution in EEG recordings. The aim of 
      this paper was to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of 
      ocular filtering methods with respect to spectral target variables widely used in 
      clinical and functional EEG studies. In particular the following methods were 
      applied: regression analysis and some blind source separation (BSS) techniques 
      based on second-order statistics (PCA, AMUSE and SOBI) and on higher-order 
      statistics (JADE, INFOMAX and FASTICA). Considering blind source decomposition 
      methods, a completely automatic procedure of BSS based on logical rules related 
      to spectral and topographical information was proposed in order to identify the 
      components related to ocular interference. The automatic procedure was applied in 
      different montages of simulated EEG and electrooculography (EOG) recordings: a 
      full montage with 19 EEG and 2 EOG channels, a reduced one with only 6 EEG leads 
      and a third one where EOG channels were not available. Time and frequency results 
      in all of them indicated that AMUSE and SOBI algorithms preserved and recovered 
      more brain activity than the other methods mainly at anterior regions. In the 
      case of full montage: (i) errors were lower than 5% for all spectral variables at 
      anterior sites; and (ii) the highest improvement in the signal-to-artifact (SAR) 
      ratio was obtained up to 40dB at these anterior sites. Finally, we concluded that 
      second-order BSS-based algorithms (AMUSE and SOBI) provided an effective 
      technique for eye movement removal even when EOG recordings were not available or 
      when data length was short.

TI  - Auto-adaptive averaging: detecting artifacts in event-related potential data 
      using a fully automated procedure.
PG  - 216-28
AB  - The auto-adaptive averaging procedure proposed here classifies artifacts in 
      event-related potential data by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. This method 
      rank orders single trials according to the impact of each trial on the ERP 
      average. Then, the minimum residual background noise level in the ERP data is 
      determined at each step in the averaging process. Trials having a negative impact 
      on the residual background noise are discarded from the averaging procedure. 
      Simulations showed that ERP estimates obtained by the auto-adaptive averaging 
      procedure were either better or comparable to those obtained by single trial 
      artifact detection methods at their most optimum configuration, in particular 
      during long duration artifacts. Experimental data from a working memory task 
      further illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Unmixing concurrent EEG-fMRI with parallel independent component analysis.
PG  - 222-34
AB  - Concurrent event-related EEG-fMRI recordings pick up volume-conducted and 
      hemodynamically convoluted signals from latent neural sources that are spatially 
      and temporally mixed across the brain, i.e. the observed data in both modalities 
      represent multiple, simultaneously active, regionally overlapping neuronal mass 
      responses. This mixing process decreases the sensitivity of voxel-by-voxel 
      prediction of hemodynamic activation by the EEG when multiple sources contribute 
      to either the predictor and/or the response variables. In order to address this 
      problem, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to recover maps from the 
      fMRI and timecourses from the EEG, and matched these components across the 
      modalities by correlating their trial-to-trial modulation. The analysis was 
      implemented as a group-level ICA that extracts a single set of components from 
      the data and directly allows for population inferences about consistently 
      expressed function-relevant spatiotemporal responses. We illustrate the utility 
      of this method by extracting a previously undetected but relevant EEG-fMRI 
      component from a concurrent auditory target detection experiment.

TI  - Evaluating and monitoring analgesia and sedation in the intensive care unit.
PG  - S2

AB  - Management of analgesia and sedation in the intensive care unit requires 
      evaluation and monitoring of key parameters in order to detect and quantify pain 
      and agitation, and to quantify sedation. The routine use of subjective scales for 
      pain, agitation, and sedation promotes more effective management, including 
      patient-focused titration of medications to specific end-points. The need for 
      frequent measurement reflects the dynamic nature of pain, agitation, and 
      sedation, which change constantly in critically ill patients. Further, close 
      monitoring promotes repeated evaluation of response to therapy, thus helping to 
      avoid over-sedation and to eliminate pain and agitation. Pain assessment tools 
      include self-report (often using a numeric pain scale) for communicative patients 
      and pain scales that incorporate observed behaviors and physiologic measures for 
      noncommunicative patients. Some of these tools have undergone validity testing 
      but more work is needed. Sedation-agitation scales can be used to identify and 
      quantify agitation, and to grade the depth of sedation. Some scales incorporate a 
      step-wise assessment of response to increasingly noxious stimuli and a brief 
      assessment of cognition to define levels of consciousness; these tools can often 
      be quickly performed and easily recalled. Many of the sedation-agitation scales 
      have been extensively tested for inter-rater reliability and validated against a 
      variety of parameters. Objective measurement of indicators of consciousness and 
      brain function, such as with processed electroencephalography signals, holds 
      considerable promise, but has not achieved widespread implementation. Further 
      clarification of the roles of these tools, particularly within the context of 
      patient safety, is needed, as is further technology development to eliminate 
      artifacts and investigation to demonstrate added value.

TI  - Smaller feedback ERN amplitudes during the BART are associated with a greater 
      family history density of alcohol problems in treatment-naïve alcoholics.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcoholism is characterized by impaired decision-making (i.e., 
      choosing intoxication in the face of mounting negative consequences). This 
      impairment may involve a reduced brain response to the negative consequences of 
      behavior, which supports an inclination to engage in risky behaviors. The 
      feedback error-related negativity (F-ERN) is hypothesized to reflect the valence 
      attached to the negative consequences of behavior. Performance on the Balloon 
      Analogue Risk Task (BART) measures risk-taking propensity. We recorded F-ERNs 
      during the BART and during a BART simulation, where individuals observed the 
      rewards and consequences of (someone else's) BART performance. METHODS: EEGs were 
      recorded on 22 actively drinking, treatment-naïve alcoholics during the BART and 
      BART simulation. F-ERNs were measured and their association with psychological 
      and alcohol use measures was examined. RESULTS: F-ERNs over fronto-central 
      electrode sites were observed to balloon pops in the BART and BART simulation. 
      F-ERNs during the BART were more than twice the amplitude of F-ERNs during the 
      BART simulation. Smaller F-ERN amplitudes from the BART (but not the BART 
      simulation) were associated with a greater family history density of alcohol 
      problems. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible link between the genetic 
      vulnerability toward developing alcoholism and the brain's response to the 
      negative consequences of behavior.

TI  - Effect of heartbeat perception on heartbeat evoked potential waves.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early researches found that different heartbeat perceivers have 
      different heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) waves. Two tasks were considered in 
      our experiments to get more details about the differences between good and poor 
      heartbeat perceivers at attention and resting state. METHODS: Thirty channels of 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in 22 subjects, who had been subdivided 
      into good and poor heartbeat perceivers by mental tracking task. Principal 
      component analysis (PCA) was applied to remove cardiac field artifact (CFA) from 
      the HEP. RESULTS: (1) The good heart-beat perceivers showed difference between 
      attention and resting state in the windows from 250 ms to 450 ms after R wave at 
      C3 location and from 100 ms to 300 ms after R wave at C4 location; (2) The 
      difference waveforms between good and poor heartbeat perceivers was a positive 
      waveform at FZ from 220 ms to 340 ms after R wave, which was more significant in 
      attention state. CONCLUSION: Attention state had more effect on the HEPs of good 
      heartbeat perceivers than that of poor heartbeat perceivers; and perception 
      ability influenced HEPs more strongly in the attention state than in the resting 
      state.

TI  - A comparative study of different artefact removal algorithms for EEG signals 
      acquired during functional MRI.
PG  - 124-37
AB  - In electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements performed during functional 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), imaging and cardiac artefacts strongly 
      contaminate the EEG signal. Several algorithms have been proposed to suppress 
      these artefacts and most of them have shown important improvements with respect 
      to uncorrected signals. However, the relative performances of these algorithms 
      have not been properly assessed. In particular, it is not known to what extent 
      such algorithms deteriorate the EEG signal of interest. In this study, we propose 
      to cross-validate different methods proposed for artefact correction, using a 
      forward model to generate EEG and MR-related artefacts. The methods are assessed 
      under various experimental conditions (described in terms of EEG sampling rate, 
      artefacts amplitude, frequency band of interest, etc.). Using experimental data, 
      we also tested the performance of the correction methods for alpha rhythm imaging 
      and for epileptic spike reconstruction. Results show that most of the methods 
      allow the observation of the modulation of alpha rhythms and the identification 
      of spikes, despite subtle differences between algorithms. They also show that 
      over-filtering the data may degrade the EEG. Our results indicate that the 
      optimal artefact removal technique should be chosen according to whether one is 
      interested in fast (>10 Hz) vs. slow (<10 Hz) oscillations or in evoked vs. 
      ongoing activity.

AB  - We present an algorithm for removing environmental noise from neurophysiological 
      recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Noise fields measured by 
      reference magnetometers are optimally filtered and subtracted from brain 
      channels. The filters (one per reference/brain sensor pair) are obtained by 
      delaying the reference signals, orthogonalizing them to obtain a basis, 
      projecting the brain sensors onto the noise-derived basis, and removing the 
      projections to obtain clean data. Simulations with synthetic data suggest that 
      distortion of brain signals is minimal. The method surpasses previous methods by 
      synthesizing, for each reference/brain sensor pair, a filter that compensates for 
      convolutive mismatches between sensors. The method enhances the value of data 
      recorded in health and scientific applications by suppressing harmful noise, and 
      reduces the need for deleterious spatial or spectral filtering. It should be 
      applicable to a wider range of physiological recording techniques, such as EEG, 
      local field potentials, etc.

TI  - Origin of the radio frequency pulse artifact in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording: 
      rectification at the carbon-metal interface.
PG  - 1725-7
AB  - Simultaneous electroencephalograph-functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (EEG-fMRI) recording has become an important tool for investigating 
      spatiotemporal properties of brain events, such as epilepsy, evoked brain 
      responses, and changes in brain rhythms. Reduction of noise in EEG signals during 
      fMRI recording is crucial for acquiring high-quality EEG-fMRI data. The main 
      source of the noise includes the gradient artifact, the radio frequency (RF) 
      pulse artifact, and the cardiac pulse artifact. Since the RF pulse artifact is 
      relatively small in amplitude, little attention has been paid to this artifact, 
      and its origin is not well understood. However, the amplitude of the RF pulse 
      artifact fluctuates randomly even if a very high EEG sampling rate is used, 
      making it more salient than the gradient artifact after postprocessing for noise 
      removal. In this paper, we investigate the cause of the RF pulse artifact in EEG 
      systems that use carbon wires.

TI  - Single trial classification of motor imagination using 6 dry EEG electrodes.
PG  - e637
LID - e637
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain computer interfaces (BCI) based on electro-encephalography 
      (EEG) have been shown to detect mental states accurately and non-invasively, but 
      the equipment required so far is cumbersome and the resulting signal is difficult 
      to analyze. BCI requires accurate classification of small amplitude brain signal 
      components in single trials from recordings which can be compromised by currents 
      induced by muscle activity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A novel EEG cap based 
      on dry electrodes was developed which does not need time-consuming gel 
      application and uses far fewer electrodes than on a standard EEG cap set-up. 
      After optimizing the placement of the 6 dry electrodes through off-line analysis 
      of standard cap experiments, dry cap performance was tested in the context of a 
      well established BCI cursor control paradigm in 5 healthy subjects using analysis 
      methods which do not necessitate user training. The resulting information 
      transfer rate was on average about 30% slower than the standard cap. The 
      potential contribution of involuntary muscle activity artifact to the BCI control 
      signal was found to be inconsequential, while the detected signal was consistent 
      with brain activity originating near the motor cortex. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Our study shows that a surprisingly simple and convenient method of brain 
      activity imaging is possible, and that simple and robust analysis techniques 
      exist which discriminate among mental states in single trials. Within 15 minutes 
      the dry BCI device is set-up, calibrated and ready to use. Peak performance 
      matched reported EEG BCI state of the art in one subject. The results promise a 
      practical non-invasive BCI solution for severely paralyzed patients, without the 
      bottleneck of setup effort and limited recording duration that hampers current 
      EEG recording technique. The presented recording method itself, BCI not 
      considered, could significantly widen the use of EEG for emerging applications 
      requiring long-term brain activity and mental state monitoring.

TI  - Adaptive filtering for global interference cancellation and real-time recovery of 
      evoked brain activity: a Monte Carlo simulation study.
PG  - 044014
AB  - The sensitivity of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to evoked brain activity is 
      reduced by physiological interference in at least two locations: 1. the 
      superficial scalp and skull layers, and 2. in brain tissue itself. These 
      interferences are generally termed as "global interferences" or "systemic 
      interferences," and arise from cardiac activity, respiration, and other 
      homeostatic processes. We present a novel method for global interference 
      reduction and real-time recovery of evoked brain activity, based on the 
      combination of a multiseparation probe configuration and adaptive filtering. 
      Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this method can be effective in reducing 
      the global interference and recovering otherwise obscured evoked brain activity. 
      We also demonstrate that the physiological interference in the superficial layers 
      is the major component of global interference. Thus, a measurement of superficial 
      layer hemodynamics (e.g., using a short source-detector separation) makes a good 
      reference in adaptive interference cancellation. The adaptive-filtering-based 
      algorithm is shown to be resistant to errors in source-detector position 
      information as well as to errors in the differential pathlength factor (DPF). The 
      technique can be performed in real time, an important feature required for 
      applications such as brain activity localization, biofeedback, and potential 
      neuroprosthetic devices.

TI  - An MEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI).
PG  - 581-93
AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for communicating intentions by mere brain 
      activity, not involving muscles. Thus, BCIs may offer patients who have lost all 
      voluntary muscle control the only possible way to communicate. Many recent 
      studies have demonstrated that BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) can 
      allow healthy and severely paralyzed individuals to communicate. While this 
      approach is safe and inexpensive, communication is slow. Magnetoencephalography 
      (MEG) provides signals with higher spatiotemporal resolution than EEG and could 
      thus be used to explore whether these improved signal properties translate into 
      increased BCI communication speed. In this study, we investigated the utility of 
      an MEG-based BCI that uses voluntary amplitude modulation of sensorimotor mu and 
      beta rhythms. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we present a simple spatial 
      filtering method that takes the geometric properties of signal propagation in MEG 
      into account, and we present methods that can process artifacts specifically 
      encountered in an MEG-based BCI. Exemplarily, six participants were successfully 
      trained to communicate binary decisions by imagery of limb movements using a 
      feedback paradigm. Participants achieved significant mu rhythm self control 
      within 32 min of feedback training. For a subgroup of three participants, we 
      localized the origin of the amplitude modulated signal to the motor cortex. Our 
      results suggest that an MEG-based BCI is feasible and efficient in terms of user 
      training.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of fetal bio-magnetic signals.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - Non-invasive technique such as magneto-encephalography (MEG), initially pioneered 
      to study human brain signals, has found many other applications in medicine. 
      SQUID(1) Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) is a unique non-invasive 
      scanning-device developed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences 
      (UAMS) that can detect fetal brain and other signals. The fetal 
      magneto-encephalography (fMEG) signals often have many bio-magnetic signals mixed 
      in. Examples include the movement of the fetus or muscle contraction of the 
      mother. As a result, the recorded signals may show unexpected patterns, other 
      than the target signal of interest. These "interventions" make it difficult for a 
      physician to assess the exact fetal condition, including its response to various 
      stimuli. We propose using intervention analysis and spatial-temporal 
      auto-regressive moving-average (STARMA) modeling to address the problem. STARMA 
      is a statistical method that examines the relationship between the current 
      observations as a linear combination of past observations as well as observations 
      at neighboring sensors. Through intervention analysis, the change in a pattern 
      due to "interfering" signals can be accounted for. When these interferences are 
      "removed," the end product is a "template" time series, or a typical signal from 
      the target of interest. In this research, a "universal" template is obtained. The 
      template is then used to detect intervention in other datasets by the method of 
      template matching. By this method, it is possible to detect if there is an 
      intervention in any dataset. It will assist physicians in monitoring the actual 
      signal generated by fetal brain and other organs of interest.

TI  - Improving the interpretation of ictal scalp EEG: BSS-CCA algorithm for muscle 
      artifact removal.
PG  - 950-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential clinical relevance of a new algorithm to 
      remove muscle artifacts in ictal scalp EEG. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with 
      refractory partial epilepsy with a well-defined seizure onset zone based on full 
      presurgical evaluation, including SISCOM but excluding ictal EEG findings, were 
      included. One ictal EEG of each patient was presented to a clinical 
      neurophysiologist who was blinded to all other data. Ictal EEGs were first rated 
      after band-pass filtering, then after elimination of muscle artifacts using a 
      blind source separation-canonical correlation analysis technique (BSS-CCA). 
      Degree of muscle artifact contamination, lateralization, localization, time and 
      pattern of ictal EEG onset were compared between the two readings and validated 
      against the other localizing information. RESULTS: Muscle artifacts contaminated 
      97% of ictal EEGs, and interfered with the interpretation in 76%, more often in 
      extratemporal than temporal lobe seizures. BSS-CCA significantly improved the 
      sensitivity to localize the seizure onset from 62% to 81%, and performed best in 
      ictal EEGs with moderate to severe muscle artifact contamination. In a 
      significant number of the contaminated EEGs, BSS-CCA also led to an earlier 
      identification of ictal EEG changes, and recognition of ictal EEG patterns that 
      were hidden by muscle artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle artifacts interfered with the 
      interpretation in a majority of ictal EEGs. BSS-CCA reliably removed these muscle 
      artifacts in a user-friendly manner. BSS-CCA may have an important place in the 
      interpretation of ictal EEGs during presurgical evaluation of patients with 
      refractory partial epilepsy.

TI  - Electroencephalography artifacts in workplace alertness monitoring.
PG  - 148-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effect of removing artifacts from workplace 
      electroencephalography (EEG) recordings on power spectra and the consequent 
      interpretation of changes in alertness. METHODS: EEG was recorded for 27 air 
      traffic controllers on the night shifts of four roster cycles. On two of the four 
      night shifts, each controller was given a 40-minute opportunity to nap, while on 
      the other two they remained awake (105 shifts in total). Recordings for the last 
      hour of each night shift were screened for artifacts by an experienced viewer 
      (who viewed the EEG in isolation from other electrophysiological recordings). The 
      effects of the nap opportunity on the EEG power spectra were then analyzed in a 
      mixed model analysis of variance in the presence and absence of 
      artifact-contaminated data. RESULTS: Overall, 89.3% of the EEG recordings 
      contained artifacts. Removal of these data markedly altered the interpretation of 
      how the nap opportunities affected the EEG power spectra. The spectral parameters 
      of the artifact appeared to be different when the participants were given the 
      opportunity to nap. CONCLUSIONS: Removal of artifacts can dramatically affect the 
      interpretation of workplace EEG recordings. This potential source of error is 
      often unreported.

      widely accepted that independent component analysis (ICA) may be a useful tool 
      for isolating artifacts and/or cortical processes from electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) data. We present results of simulations demonstrating that ICA 
      decomposition, here tested using three popular ICA algorithms, Infomax, SOBI, and 
      FastICA, can allow more sensitive automated detection of small non-brain 
      artifacts than applying the same detection methods directly to the scalp channel 
      data. We tested the upper bound performance of five methods for detecting various 
      types of artifacts by separately optimizing and then applying them to 
      artifact-free EEG data into which we had added simulated artifacts of several 
      types, ranging in size from thirty times smaller (-50 dB) to the size of the EEG 
      data themselves (0 dB). Of the methods tested, those involving spectral 
      thresholding were most sensitive. Except for muscle artifact detection where we 
      found no gain of using ICA, all methods proved more sensitive when applied to the 
      ICA-decomposed data than applied to the raw scalp data: the mean performance for 
      ICA was higher and situated at about two standard deviations away from the 
      performance distribution obtained on raw data. We note that ICA decomposition 
      also allows simple subtraction of artifacts accounted for by single independent 
      components, and/or separate and direct examination of the decomposed non-artifact 
      processes themselves.

TI  - Reduction of EEG myogenic artifact with botulinum toxin during video-EEG 
      monitoring.
PG  - 324-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether EEG myogenic artifact during video-EEG monitoring 
      (VEM) is reduced with targeted scalp botulinum toxin (BTX-A) injections. METHODS: 
      Twelve consecutive patients scheduled for presurgical VEM were treated 2-3 weeks 
      before admission with subcutaneous BTX-A injections at specific EEG electrode 
      locations. On the basis of clinical data available before VEM, four subjects were 
      treated unilaterally (group 1) and eight bilaterally (group 2). BTX-A efficacy 
      was assessed quantitatively in group 1 subjects by comparing high-frequency 
      (20-100 Hz) power at homologous "treated" and "untreated" electrodes during 
      voluntary forceful jaw closure. The clinical impact of BTX-A treatment was 
      assessed by determining whether > or =5 of the first 10 s of each ictal recording 
      was obscured by muscle artifact, and whether residual myogenic artifact on 
      BTX-A-"treated" electrodes rendered these ictal EEG segments impossible to 
      interpret. RESULTS: BTX-A treatment reduced high-frequency power by a mean of 53% 
      at electrodes T3/T4 and 52% at electrodes F7/F8. None of 49 ictal EEGs had > or 
      =5 of the first 10 s obscured by myogenic artifact, and all of these ictal epochs 
      were interpretable. Adverse events were limited to two subjects who complained of 
      transient difficulty chewing tough foods. CONCLUSIONS: Scalp-muscle BTX-A 
      treatment before VEM significantly reduces myogenic artifact in subsequent EEG 
      recordings, including ictal EEG. The clinical utility of this technique for 
      improved or more-rapid seizure localization will be determined only by large, 
      blinded, prospective trials.

TI  - PET imaging in the photosensitive baboon: case-controlled study.
PG  - 245-53
AB  - PURPOSE: The baboon (Papio hamadryas spp) offers a natural primate animal model 
      of photosensitive generalized epilepsy. This study compared changes in cerebral 
      blood flow (CBF) during intermittent light stimulation (ILS) between 
      photosensitive and asymptomatic baboons. METHODS: Six photosensitive, epileptic 
      (PS) and four nonphotosensitive, asymptomatic (CTL) baboons, matched for age, 
      gender, and weight, were selected based on previous scalp EEG evaluation. 
      Continuous intravenous ketamine (5-13 mg/kg) was used for sedation. Subjects 
      underwent five sequential blood-flow PET studies within 60 min with 20 mCi 
      (15)O-labeled water. Images were acquired in 3D mode (CTI/Siemens HR+ scanner, 63 
      contiguous slices, 2.4-mm thickness). Three resting scans were alternated with 
      two activation scans during ILS. ILS was performed at 25 Hz for 60 s before to 60 
      s after the start of an activation scan. PET images were coregistered with MRI 
      (3T Siemens Trio, T(1)-weighted 3D Turboflash sequence; TE/TR/TI, 3.04/2,100/785 
      ms; flip angle, 13 degrees). PET scans were reviewed and corrected for motion 
      artifact. Resting scans were contrasted with activation scans and averaged 
      independently for both groups. Quantitative CBF analyses were performed for the 
      occipital and motor cortices. RESULTS: The CTL baboons showed greatest 
      ILS-induced activation in the left middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri, 
      left brainstem structures and right postcentral gyrus, bilateral occipital lobes, 
      and in the posterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. In contrast, the PS animals 
      showed strongest ILS activation in the right anterior cingulate and medial 
      orbital gyri, amygdala, globus pallidum, and left inferior and superior temporal 
      gyri. A striking finding was the absence of occipital and variable motor cortex 
      activation in the PS animals. Deactivations were noted in the right orbitofrontal 
      and anterior cingulate cortices in the CTL baboons and in the posterior cingulate 
      gyrus, brainstem and cerebellum of the PS animals. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of 
      ILS-induced CBF changes differed between CTL and PS groups. These differences of 
      activations and inhibitions suggest involvement of specific cortical-subcortical 
      or networks in photosensitivity.

TI  - Complete artifact removal for EEG recorded during continuous fMRI using 
      independent component analysis.
PG  - 598-607
AB  - The simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI is a promising method for combining 
      the electrophysiological and hemodynamic information on cerebral dynamics. 
      However, EEG recordings performed in the MRI scanner are contaminated by imaging, 
      ballistocardiographic (BCG) and ocular artifacts. A number of processing 
      techniques for the cancellation of fMRI environment disturbances exist: the most 
      popular is averaged artifact subtraction (AAS), which performs well for the 
      imaging artifact, but has some limitations in removing the BCG artifact, due to 
      the variability in cardiac wave duration and shape; furthermore, no processing 
      method to attenuate ocular artifact is currently used in EEG/fMRI, and 
      contaminated epochs are simply rejected before signal analysis. In this work, we 
      present a comprehensive method based on independent component analysis (ICA) for 
      simultaneously removing BCG and ocular artifacts from the EEG recordings, as well 
      as residual MRI contamination left by AAS. The ICA method has been tested on 
      event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from a visual oddball paradigm: it is 
      very effective in attenuating artifacts in order to reconstruct clear brain 
      signals from EEG acquired in the MRI scanner. It performs significantly better 
      than the AAS method in removing the BCG artifact. Furthermore, since ocular 
      artifacts can be completely suppressed, a larger number of trials is available 
      for analysis. A comparison of ERPs inside the magnetic environment with those 
      obtained out of the MRI scanner confirms that no systematic bias in the ERP 
      waveform is produced by the ICA method.

AB  - We propose a novel framework to reduce background electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      artifacts from multitrial visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) signals for use in 
      brain-computer interface (BCI) design. An algorithm based on cyclostationary (CS) 
      analysis is introduced to locate the suitable frequency ranges that contain the 
      stimulus-related VEP components. CS technique does not require VEP recordings to 
      be phase locked and exploits the intertrial similarities of the VEP components in 
      the frequency domain. The obtained cyclic frequency spectrum enables detection of 
      VEP frequency band. Next, bandpass or lowpass filtering is performed to reduce 
      the EEG artifacts using these identified frequency ranges. This is followed by 
      overlapping band EEG artifact reduction using genetic algorithm and independent 
      component analysis (G-ICA) which uses mutual information (MI) criterion to 
      separate EEG artifacts from VEP. The CS and GA methods need to be applied only to 
      the training data; for the test data, the knowledge of the cyclic frequency bands 
      and unmixing matrix would be sufficient for enhanced VEP detection. Hence, the 
      framework could be used for online VEP detection. This framework was tested with 
      various datasets and it showed satisfactory results with very few trials. Since 
      the framework is general, it could be applied to the enhancement of evoked 
      potential signals for any application.

AB  - We present the self-paced 3-class Graz brain-computer interface (BCI) which is 
      based on the detection of sensorimotor electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms induced 
      by motor imagery. Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine 
      whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal (intentional 
      control) or not (non-control state). The presented system is able to 
      automatically reduce electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, to detect 
      electromyographic (EMG) activity, and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two 
      applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment (VE) and the 
      Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where 
      subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by 
      autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these 
      feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect 
      coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins. The 
      Brainloop interface provides an interface between the Graz-BCI and Google Earth.

LID - 75079
AB  - To cope with the severe masking of background cerebral activity in the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) by ocular movement artefacts, we present a method 
      which combines lower-order, short-term and higher-order, long-term statistics. 
      The joint smoothened subspace estimator (JSSE) calculates the joint information 
      in both statistical models, subject to the constraint that the resulting 
      estimated source should be sufficiently smooth in the time domain (i.e., has a 
      large autocorrelation or self predictive power). It is shown that the JSSE is 
      able to estimate a component from simulated data that is superior with respect to 
      methodological artefact suppression to those of FastICA, SOBI, pSVD, or JADE/COM1 
      algorithms used for blind source separation (BSS). Interference and distortion 
      suppression are of comparable order when compared with the above-mentioned 
      methods. Results on patient data demonstrate that the method is able to suppress 
      blinking and saccade artefacts in a fully automated way.

TI  - Dataset of manually measured QT intervals in the electrocardiogram.
PG  - 31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The QT interval and the QT dispersion are currently a subject of 
      considerable interest. Cardiac repolarization delay is known to favor the 
      development of arrhythmias. The QT dispersion, defined as the difference between 
      the longest and the shortest QT intervals or as the standard deviation of the QT 
      duration in the 12-lead ECG is assumed to be reliable predictor of cardiovascular 
      mortality. The seventh annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge, 2006 
      addresses a question of high clinical interest: Can the QT interval be measured 
      by fully automated methods with accuracy acceptable for clinical evaluations? 
      METHOD: The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database was given to 4 cardiologists and 1 
      biomedical engineer for manual marking of QRS onsets and T-wave ends in 458 
      recordings. Each recording consisted of one selected beat in lead II, chosen 
      visually to have minimum baseline shift, noise, and artifact.In cases where no T 
      wave could be observed or its amplitude was very small, the referees were 
      instructed to mark a 'group-T-wave end' taking into consideration leads with 
      better manifested T wave.A modified Delphi approach was used, which included up 
      to three rounds of measurements to obtain results closer to the median. RESULTS: 
      A total amount of 2*5*548 Q-onsets and T-wave ends were manually marked during 
      round 1. To obtain closer to the median results, 8.58 % of Q-onsets and 3.21 % of 
      the T-wave ends had to be reviewed during round 2, and 1.50 % Q-onsets and 1.17 % 
      T-wave ends in round 3. The mean and standard deviation of the differences 
      between the values of the referees and the median after round 3 were 2.43 +/- 
      0.96 ms for the Q-onset, and 7.43 +/- 3.44 ms for the T-wave end. CONCLUSION: A 
      fully accessible, on the Internet, dataset of manually measured Q-onsets and 
      T-wave ends was created and presented in additional file: 1 (Table 4) with this 
      article. Thus, an available standard can be used for the development of automated 
      methods for the detection of Q-onsets, T-wave ends and for QT interval 
      measurements.

TI  - A graphical model for estimating stimulus-evoked brain responses from 
      magnetoencephalography data with large background brain activity.
PG  - 400-16
AB  - This paper formulates a novel probabilistic graphical model for noisy 
      stimulus-evoked MEG and EEG sensor data obtained in the presence of large 
      background brain activity. The model describes the observed data in terms of 
      unobserved evoked and background factors with additive sensor noise. We present 
      an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that estimates the model parameters 
      from data. Using the model, the algorithm cleans the stimulus-evoked data by 
      removing interference from background factors and noise artifacts and separates 
      those data into contributions from independent factors. We demonstrate on real 
      and simulated data that the algorithm outperforms benchmark methods for denoising 
      and separation. We also show that the algorithm improves the performance of 
      localization with beamforming algorithms.

TI  - Temporal and extratemporal BOLD responses to temporal lobe interictal spikes.
PG  - 343-54
AB  - PURPOSE: Simultaneous EEG and functional MRI (fMRI) allows measuring metabolic 
      changes related to interictal spikes. Our objective was to investigate blood 
      oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to temporal lobe (TL) spikes by 
      using EEG-fMRI recording. METHODS: We studied 35 patients who had a diagnosis of 
      temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and active TL spiking on routine scalp EEG 
      recording. Two-hour sessions of continuous EEG-fMRI were recorded, and spikes 
      were identified after offline artifact removal and used as events in the fMRI 
      analysis. Each type of spike was analyzed separately, as one EEG-fMRI study. We 
      determined significant (p < 0.05) positive (activation) and negative 
      (deactivation) BOLD responses for each study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had 
      spikes during scanning (19 unilateral and eight bilateral). From a total of 35 
      fMRI studies, 29 (83%) showed BOLD responses: 14 had both activations and 
      deactivations; 12, activations only; and three, deactivations only. Six (17%) 
      showed no responses. Nineteen studies had mainly neocortical TL activation: 
      Sixteen (84%) of 19 concordant with spikes, 12 of 16 with concomitant activation 
      of the contralateral TL, and 16 of 19 with additional extratemporal activation; 
      few showed exclusively mesial TL activation. Seventeen studies showed 
      deactivation, either extratemporal plus temporal (n = 8) or exclusively 
      extratemporal (n = 9). CONCLUSIONS: BOLD responses to TL spikes occurred in 83% 
      of studies, predominated in the spiking temporal lobe, and manifested as 
      activation or deactivation. Responses often involved the contralateral homologous 
      cortex at the time of unilateral spikes and were frequently observed in 
      extratemporal regions, suggesting that TL epileptic spikes can affect neuronal 
      activity at a distance through synaptic connections.

TI  - [Use of the Bispectral Index in monitoring critically-ill children].
PG  - 96-9
AB  - The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a single numeric value that indicates the depth of 
      hypnosis by estimating the level of electrical activity in the brain through 
      analysis of the frequency bands in the electroencephalogram. The BIS was 
      primarily developed to monitor the level of hypnosis during surgery and has 
      recently begun to be used in critically-ill patients. Currently, there is little 
      experience of the BIS in critically-ill children. We present 6 cases that 
      illustrate the utility of BIS monitoring in the PICU. We assessed sedation and 
      analgesia during mechanical ventilation with and without neuromuscular block in 
      two patients, and the effect of anesthetic agents during a surgical procedure in 
      the PICU. The BIS was also useful in the continuous monitoring of the level of 
      consciousness in a patient with encephalitis and in the early detection of brain 
      death. Pacer-induced artefacts in the BIS value are also described. We conclude 
      that BIS monitoring may be a useful, noninvasive method for assessing the level 
      of hypnosis in critically-ill children.

AB  - This paper presents an energy ratio-based method and a wavelet-based cascaded 
      adaptive filter (CAF) for detecting and removing baseline drift from pulse

TI  - Visual evoked potentials recovered from fMRI scan periods.
PG  - 221-30
AB  - Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) may allow functional imaging of the brain at high temporal and 
      spatial resolution. Artifacts generated in the EEG signal during MR acquisition, 
      however, continue to pose a major challenge. Due to these artifacts, an 
      interleaved modus has often been used for "evoked potential" experiments, i.e., 
      only EEG signals recorded between MRI scan periods were assessed. An obvious 
      disadvantage of this approach is the loss of a portion of the EEG information, 
      which might be relevant for the specific scientific issue. In this study, 
      continuous, simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements were carried out. Visual evoked 
      potentials (VEPs) could be reconstructed reliably from periods during MR scanning 
      and in between successive scans. No significant differences between both VEPs 
      were detected. This indicates sufficient artifact removal as well as 
      physiological correspondence of VEPs in both periods. Simultaneous continuous 
      VEP-fMRI recordings are thus shown to be feasible.

TI  - Effects of skin on bias and reproducibility of near-infrared spectroscopy 
      measurement of cerebral oxygenation changes in porcine brain.
PG  - 44003
AB  - The influence of skin on the bias and reproducibility of regional cerebral 
      oxygenation measurements is investigated using cw near-infrared spectroscopy 
      (NIRS). Receiving optodes are placed over the left and right hemispheres of a 
      piglet (C3, C4 EEG placement code) and one transmitting optode centrally (Cz 
      position). Optical densities (OD) are measured during stable normo, mild, and 
      deep hypoxemia. This is done for skin condition 1: all optodes on the skin; skin 
      condition 2: transmitting optode on the skin and one receiving optode on the 
      skull; and skin condition 3: all optodes on the skull. Absolute changes of oxy- 
      (cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (cHHb), and total hemoglobin (ctHb) concentrations 
      [micromolL] are calculated from the ODs. These absolute changes are calculated 
      for each skin condition with respect to normoxic condition. Additionally, for 
      skin condition 2, the difference of concentration changes between receiver 1 
      (skull) and receiver 2 (skin) is calculated. The effect of skin removal is an 
      average increase of attenuation changes by a factor of 1.66 (=0.51 OD) and of the 
      concentration changes due to the arterial oxygen saturation steps by 23%. We 
      conclude that skin significantly influences regional oxygenation measurements. 
      Nevertheless, it is hypothesized that the estimated concentration changes are 
      dominated by changes of the oxygenation in the brain.

TI  - Visual evoked potentials may be recorded simultaneously with fMRI scanning: A 
      validation study.
PG  - 291-8
AB  - Integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) data may help to optimize anatomical and temporal resolution in 
      the investigation of cortical function. Successful removal of fMRI scanning 
      artifacts from continuous EEG in simultaneous recordings has been reported. We 
      assessed the feasibility of recording reliable visual evoked potentials (VEPs) 
      during fMRI scanning using available artifact removing procedures. EEG during 
      administration of visual stimuli was recorded using MRI-compatible 32-channel 
      equipment in nine normal subjects (mean age, 23.9 +/- 2.5 years), with and 
      without fMRI acquisition. fMRI scanning and cardioballistographic artifacts were 
      removed after subtraction of averaged artifact waveforms. Consistency between 
      VEPs waveforms and of P1 and N1 peak latencies and amplitudes in the two 
      conditions was assessed. Good correlation was found between VEP waveforms 
      (Pearson's correlation coefficient: r(P) between 0.76-0.94 across subjects; P < 
      0.0001) and between latency or amplitude of P1 and N1 peaks (latencies: r = 0.7, 
      P < 0.035; amplitudes: r > 0.65, P < 0.05; Spearman rank correlation coefficient) 
      in the two recording conditions. No significant differences were found between P1 
      and N1 parameters in the two conditions (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Consistent 
      VEP waveforms, latencies, and amplitudes with and without fMRI scanning indicate 
      that reliable VEPs may be obtained simultaneously with fMRI recording. This 
      possibility might be helpful by shortening recording times and reducing 
      variability from learning, habituation, and fatigue phenomena from separate 
      recordings for the integration of event-related EEG and fMRI data.

TI  - Removing eye-movement artifacts from the EEG during the intracarotid amobarbital 
      procedure.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - PURPOSE: The EEG is often recorded during the intracarotid amobarbital procedure 
      (IAP) to help in the assessment of the spatial extent and the duration of the 
      effect of the drug. In scalp recordings, the EEG is always heavily contaminated 
      with eye movement artifacts as the patient actively performs visual tasks. 
      METHODS: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a new technique for blind source 
      separation. In this study, we separated the EEG data recorded during the IAP into 
      independent components using ICA. The EEG signal was reconstructed by excluding 
      the components related to eye movement and eye blinks. RESULTS: EEGs from 10 IAP 
      tests were analyzed. The experimental results indicate that ICA is very efficient 
      at subtracting eye-movement artifacts, while retaining the EEG slow waves and 
      making their interpretation easier. CONCLUSIONS: ICA appears to be a generally 
      applicable and effective method for removing ocular artifacts from EEG recordings 
      during IAP, although slow waves and ocular artifacts share similar frequency 
      distributions.

TI  - Real-time display of artifact-free electroencephalography during functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in an animal model 
      of epilepsy.
PG  - 456-64
AB  - Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) or 
      MR spectroscopy (MRS) can provide further insight into our understanding of the 
      underlying mechanisms of neurologic disorders. Current technology for 
      simultaneous EEG and MRI recording is limited by extensive postacquisition 
      processing of the data. Real-time display of artifact-free EEG recording during 
      fMRI/MRS studies is essential in studies that involve epilepsy to ensure that 
      they address specific EEG features such as epileptic spikes or seizures. By 
      optimizing the EEG recording equipment to maximize the common mode rejection 
      ratio of its amplifiers, a unique EEG system was designed and tested that allowed 
      real-time display of the artifact-free EEG during fMRI/MRS in an animal model of 
      epilepsy. Spike recordings were optimized by suppression of the background EEG 
      activity using fast-acting and easily controlled inhalational anesthesia. 
      Artifact suppression efficiency of 70-100% was achieved following direct 
      subtraction of referentially recorded filtered EEG tracings from active 
      electrodes, which were located in close proximity to each other (over homologous 
      occipital cortices) and a reference electrode. Two independent postacquisition 
      processing tools, independent component analysis and direct subtraction of 
      unfiltered digital EEG data in MATLAB, were used to verify the accuracy of 
      real-time EEG display.

AB  - "Use a quiet reference." How many times have we heard this mantra during training 
      or practice, interpreting electroencephalogram (EEG) tracings, or implanting 
      intracranial electrodes? How many of us have used common reference EEG for 
      synchrony studies in recent years? Far too many.Perhaps one source of this 
      problem is the number 104. This is the relatively small number of citations to 
      the reference Fein et al. (1988), which should have put to rest any further use 
      of referential EEG for coherence measurements. And in retrospect, a more careful 
      reading by us of Nunez's (1981) text would have instructed us not to do this. How 
      such warnings have managed to escape integration into common knowledge and 
      practice is troublesome. Electrical potentials are all measured with respect to 
      other potentials. Technically, a potential difference is calculated by 
      integrating the electrical field over a given path from one place to another in 
      EEG terms, we mea sure a potential with respect to another potential, measured at 
      one or more electrodes. All EEG potential measurements reflect the paths used to 
      measure those potentials, and do not directly reflect localized regions of the 
      brain beneath one electrode. Worse, in scalp EEG, the layers of cerebrospinal 
      fluid, dura, skull, and scalp serve to smooth, filter, spread out, and redirect 
      currents generated within the brain so that the measured scalp potentials bear a 
      rather tenuous relationship to the underlying (presumably dipole) current 
      sources. In calculating coherence, it is easy to show that if the potential 
      differences are all made with respect to a common reference, then the amplitude 
      of the reference can dominate the coherence estimate (Fein et al., 1988). In 
      recent years, phase synchronization has been increasingly applied to analyze the 
      dynamics of nonlinear systems (Pikovsky et al., 2000). In Guevara et al. (in this 
      issue), we see the extension of Fein's results for phase coherency. The geometry 
      of Fig. 1 in Guevara et al. should be imprinted on all of us the amplitude of a 
      common reference can dominate the calculated phase syn chronization. There is far 
      too much literature within the past decade that calculated phase synchronization 
      from common referenced EEG. The good news is that the fix to remove common 
      reference artifacts is simple. The bad news is that the interpretation of 
      reference- free synchronization results from brain signals requires considerable 
      caution.

TI  - [Mathematical analyses in the study of electroencephalographic signals].
PG  - 423-34
AB  - AIM: The principal mathematical techniques applied to the EEG are reviewed. 
      DEVELOPMENT: After the introduction of digital EEG, new mathematical tools have 
      been developed for the EEG analysis. Nowadays there are several techniques that 
      analyse the EEG signal in different ways, getting a better understanding of the 
      EEG: development of new montages; artifact removal; analysis in time domain, 
      phase coherence and synchrony; source analysis; epileptic seizures detection and 
      prediction; superposition of electrical activity and other neuroimaging 
      techniques. Although they have demonstrated their efficacy, the comparison 
      between them is not always easy. CONCLUSIONS: The development of mathematical 
      tools for EEG analysis has improved the knowledge of the electric cerebral 
      activity in normal and pathological conditions. They study many different aspects 
      of the EEG signal. Their continuous development will produce an increase the 
      knowledge of the normal and pathological cerebral functions.

TI  - Awareness and the EEG power spectrum: analysis of frequencies.
PG  - 806-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Power spectral analysis is a well-established method for the analysis 
      of EEG signals. Spectral parameters can be used to quantify pharmacological 
      effects of anaesthetics on the brain and the level of sedation. This method, in 
      numerous variations, has been applied to depth of anaesthesia monitoring and has 
      been incorporated into several commercially available EEG monitors. Because of 
      the importance of EEG spectral analysis, we evaluated the performance of each 
      frequency in the power spectrum regarding detection of awareness. METHODS: Ninety 
      artefact-free EEG segments of length 8 s were obtained from a database that 
      contains perioperatively recorded EEG data. For the present analysis, EEG data 
      were selected from 39 patients with propofol-remifentanil or 
      sevoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia with a period of awareness. Half of the EEG 
      segments were recorded during periods of awareness as defined by an adequate 
      response to the command 'squeeze my hand'. The other half were from unresponsive 
      patients. The power spectral density was calculated for each segment. The 
      performance of each frequency bin of the power spectrum as a detector of 
      awareness was assessed with a remapped prediction probability rPK, i.e. the 
      prediction probability PK mapped to a range of 0.5-1. RESULTS: The remapped 
      prediction probability was high (rPK>0.8) for low frequencies (<15 Hz) and for 
      high frequencies (>26 Hz), with a minimum (rPK<0.55) at 21 Hz. Indentations in 
      the 'performance spectrum' occur at the power-line frequency (50 Hz) and its 
      harmonics and at 78 Hz, probably caused by the continuous impedance measurement 
      of another device used in parallel. With the exception of the indentations, the 
      remapped prediction probability of the high frequencies (>35 Hz) was >0.95. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The best performance for the detection of awareness was achieved by 
      EEG power spectral frequencies from >35 Hz up to 127 Hz. This frequency band may 
      be dominated by muscle activity. The frequency band between 15 and 26 Hz may be 
      of limited value, as reflected by lower rPK values.

TI  - Independent component analysis removing artifacts in ictal recordings.
PG  - 1071-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a novel algorithm able to 
      separate independent components from complex signals. Studies in interictal EEG 
      demonstrate its usefulness to eliminate eye, muscle, 50-Hz, electrocardiogram 
      (ECG), and electrode artifacts. The goal of this study was to evaluate the 
      usefulness of ICA in removing artifacts in ictal recordings with a known EEG 
      onset. METHODS: We studied 20 seizures of nine patients with focal epilepsy 
      monitored in our video-EEG monitoring unit. ICA was applied to remove obvious 
      artifacts in segments at the beginning of the seizure. The final EEGs were 
      exported to the original format and were compared with the original EEG by two 
      blinded examiners. We compared original recordings and the samples cleaned by 
      digital filters (DFs), ICA and ICA plus digital filters (ICA + DFs), evaluating 
      the possibility of finding an ictal pattern, the localization of the onset in 
      area and time, and the global quality of the sample. RESULTS: All the recordings 
      except one (95%) improved after the use of ICA for the elimination of blinking 
      and other artifacts. Three seizures were found in which in the original 
      recordings did not permit us to detect an ictal pattern, and after ICA + DFs, an 
      ictal onset was evident; in two of them, ICA alone was able to show this pattern. 
      The best results in all the scores were obtained with ICA + DF. ICA was better 
      than DFs. The agreement between the two reviewers was highly significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ICA is useful to remove artifacts from ictal recordings. When 
      applied to ictal recordings, it increases the quality of the recording. In some 
      cases, ICA may be useful to show ictal onsets obscured by artifacts. ICA + DFs 
      obtained the best results regarding removal of the artifacts.

TI  - Signal verification of middle latency auditory evoked potentials by automated 
      detection of the brainstem response.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The midlatency components of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are 
      gradually suppressed with increasing concentrations of anesthetics. Thus, they 
      have been proposed as a monitor of anesthetic depth. However, undetected 
      malfunction or disconnection of headphones and undetected hearing loss also 
      result in suppressed midlatency AEPs that in turn may be misinterpreted as signs 
      of deep anesthesia. As the brainstem component of the AEP is minimally influenced 
      by anesthetics, its presence or absence can be used to verify that the recorded 
      signal is a true AEP rather than an artifact. In this study, an online-capable 
      procedure for detection of the brainstem component of the AEP was developed. 
      METHODS: One hundred and ninety perioperatively recorded AEPs (binaural stimuli, 
      500 sweeps) were selected from a database with electroencephalographic and 
      concomitant AEP stimulus information. Identical electroencephalogram regions were 
      used to produce nonstimulus synchronized averaged signals (500 sweeps, 
      "non-AEP"). The 190 AEPs and 190 "non-AEPs" were used to develop a detector of 
      the brainstem component of AEPs. AEPs and "non-AEPs" were wavelet transformed 
      (discrete wavelet decomposition, biorthogonal 2.2 mother-wavelet), and the 
      coefficient with the best separation of the two classes of signals was selected. 
      Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the 
      optimum threshold value for this coefficient. RESULTS: The third coefficient of 
      the third level was selected. In AEP signals, retransform of this coefficient 
      produces a peak that resembles peak V of the brainstem response. The developed 
      detector of the brainstem component of AEP had a sensitivity of 97.90% and a 
      specificity of 99.48%. CONCLUSIONS: This detector of the AEP brainstem component 
      can be used to verify that the signal reflects the response to an auditory 
      stimulus. An alternative approach, used in the Danmeter AEP monitor, is based on 
      the signal-to-noise ratio of the midlatency components of the AEP. Because the 
      midlatency components of AEP are suppressed by anesthesia, a false alarm "low 
      AEP/no AEP" is generated during deep anesthesia. This, in turn, may suggest 
      disconnection of headphones or technical problems whenever anesthesia is deep. 
      This disadvantage has been overcome by our detector, which is based on the 
      identification of the brainstem component of AEP.

TI  - Target selection in area V4 during a multidimensional visual search task.
PG  - 6371-82
AB  - Natural scenes typically contain multiple objects that are unique in different 
      stimulus dimensions so that an object with feature contrast to surrounding 
      objects draws attention and pops out. Furthermore, if we have previous knowledge 
      about the dimension in which a target object differs from the surrounding 
      objects, we will attend to that dimension and more easily detect the target. Our 
      aims here were to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying this type of attention 
      by recording neuronal activities from area V4 and to investigate how visual 
      signals encoding feature contrast between objects are modulated by attention 
      specific to a particular dimension. To accomplish this, we trained monkeys to do 
      a multidimensional visual search task in which two singleton stimuli, unique in 
      the color or shape dimension, were presented with four other identical stimuli. 
      The monkeys had to search for the singleton stimulus that was unique in the 
      instructed dimension while the search dimension was switched between shape and 
      color. We found that individual V4 neurons carry visual signals encoding feature 
      contrast in either shape or color, and this signal is modulated depending on the 
      search dimension. Population responses to the target singleton stimulus were 
      significantly higher than to others, regardless of the search dimension. In most 
      V4 neurons, however, significant response increases occurred only when one 
      particular singleton stimulus was the target. These findings suggest that 
      interaction between bottom-up signals encoding feature contrast between stimuli 
      and top-down signals encoding search dimension occurs in V4 and facilitates 
      adaptive selection of targets in a complex visual environment.

TI  - EEG-fMRI of focal epileptic spikes: analysis with multiple haemodynamic functions 
      and comparison with gadolinium-enhanced MR angiograms.
PG  - 179-92
AB  - Combined EEG-fMRI has recently been used to explore the BOLD responses to 
      interictal epileptiform discharges. This study examines whether misspecification 
      of the form of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) results in significant 
      fMRI responses being missed in the statistical analysis. EEG-fMRI data from 31 
      patients with focal epilepsy were analysed with four HRFs peaking from 3 to 9 sec 
      after each interictal event, in addition to a standard HRF that peaked after 5.4 
      sec. In four patients, fMRI responses were correlated with gadolinium-enhanced MR 
      angiograms and with EEG data from intracranial electrodes. In an attempt to 
      understand the absence of BOLD responses in a significant group of patients, the 
      degree of signal loss occurring as a result of magnetic field inhomogeneities was 
      compared with the detected fMRI responses in ten patients with temporal lobe 
      spikes. Using multiple HRFs resulted in an increased percentage of data sets with 
      significant fMRI activations, from 45% when using the standard HRF alone, to 
      62.5%. The standard HRF was good at detecting positive BOLD responses, but less 
      appropriate for negative BOLD responses, the majority of which were more 
      accurately modelled by an HRF that peaked later than the standard. 
      Co-registration of statistical maps with gadolinium-enhanced MRIs suggested that 
      the detected fMRI responses were not in general related to large veins. Signal 
      loss in the temporal lobes seemed to be an important factor in 7 of 12 patients 
      who did not show fMRI activations with any of the HRFs.

TI  - Electroencephalogram-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging in focal 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 319-23
AB  - The high spatial resolution and cost performance of functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) is useful for estimating focus localization in epilepsy, but this 
      is difficult in the case of ictal fMRI because this is susceptible to motion 
      artifacts. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-triggered fMRI, which is interictal, can be 
      performed without marked movement and is thought to be useful, but requires 
      further investigation in order to establish a methodology. The authors studied 
      EEG-triggered fMRI in partial epileptic patients. Six patients were examined 
      using a Nihon Kohden digital EEG recorder and Signa Horizon High Speed LX 1.5 T 
      MRI scanner. Six electrodes were attached in the vicinity of the focus detected 
      by scalp EEG. The fMRI scans were recorded after the discharges (activation) and 
      scans without spikes (baseline). Equal numbers of activation and baseline scans 
      were collected and analyzed using SPM99. In three of the six patients, an 
      activated area was observed near the focus, but no activated areas were found in 
      the other three subjects who tended to have a low number of spikes and low spike 
      amplitude. Although various approaches focusing on improvement of the 
      activation/non-activation ratio are required, EEG-triggered fMRI is a promising 
      technique for detecting focal epileptic brain activity.

TI  - Transmission of stimulus-locked responses in two coupled phase oscillators.
PG  - 051909
AB  - A model of two n:m coupled phase oscillators is studied, where both oscillators 
      are subject to random forces, but only one oscillator is repetitively stimulated 
      with a pulsatile stimulus. The focus of the paper is on transmission of transient 
      responses as well as transient synchronization and desynchronization, which are 
      stimulus locked, i.e., tightly time locked to the stimulus. A bistability or 
      multistability of stable synchronized states of the two-phase oscillators (modulo 
      2pi ) occurs due to the n:m coupling. Accordingly, after stimulation the two 
      oscillators may tend to qualitatively different stable states, which leads to a 
      cross-trial (CT) response clustering (i.e., a switching between qualitatively 
      different poststimulus responses across trials) of either one of the oscillators 
      or both. A stochastic CT phase resetting analysis allows one to detect such 
      transient responses and provides a reliable estimation of the transmission time. 
      In contrast, CT averaging (averaging over an ensemble of responses), CT standard 
      deviation, and CT cross correlation fail in studying the transmission of such 
      stimulus-locked responses, even in the simpler case of 1:1 coupling. In 
      particular, even though being used as golden standard for the analysis of evoked 
      responses in medicine and neuroscience, CT averaging typically causes severe 
      artifacts and misinterpretations.

TI  - Very fast rhythmic activity on scalp EEG associated with epileptic spasms.
PG  - 488-96
AB  - PURPOSE: Very fast activity was investigated on the ictal EEGs of epileptic 
      spasms to elucidate the pathophysiology of West syndrome (WS) and related 
      disorders from a novel point of view. METHODS: The traces of scalp ictal EEG of 
      spasms temporally were expanded in 11 patients whose clinical diagnosis was 
      symptomatic WS in six, cryptogenic WS in two, Aicardi syndrome in one, and 
      symptomatic generalized epilepsy after WS in the remaining two. Time evolution of 
      averaged power spectra of the ictal fast activity also was analyzed in each 
      patient. RESULTS: Rhythmic gamma activity with frequency ranging from 50 to 100 
      Hz was detected in a total of 345 of 537 spasms. Fast activity was seen 
      bilaterally in nine patients, was lateralized to one hemisphere in another, and 
      appeared independently on each hemisphere in the remaining infant with Aicardi 
      syndrome. Power spectra showed a clear peak corresponding to spasm-associated 
      gamma rhythm, with frequency centering approximately 65 Hz and ranging from 51 to 
      98 Hz. The morphology and spectral characteristics of ictal gamma rhythm were 
      completely different from those of muscle activity or alternating current (AC) 
      artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: Spasm-associated gamma activity was clearly detected on 
      the scalp. This observation may provide a clue to the pathophysiology of spasms.

TI  - EEGLAB: an open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics 
      including independent component analysis.
PG  - 9-21
AB  - We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the 
      crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections 
      of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available 
      functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data 
      visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial 
      ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch 
      selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and 
      time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence 
      supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB 
      functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to 
      interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use 
      MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to 
      available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing 
      using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users 
      can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to 
      write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial 
      information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new 
      EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available 
      (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial 
      use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and 
      extensive documentation.

TI  - Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to discriminate primary degenerative 
      dementia from major depressive disorder (depression).
PG  - 44-50
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) can be a valuable technique to assess 
      electrophysiological changes related to dementia. In patients suspected of having 
      dementia, the EEG is often quite informative. The sensitivity of the EEG to 
      detect correlates of psychiatric disorders has been enhanced by means of 
      quantitative methods of analysis (quantitative EEG). Quantitative features are 
      extracted from, at least, 2 minutes of artifact-free, eyes closed, resting EEG, 
      log-transformed to obtain Gaussianity, age-regressed, and Z-transformed relative 
      to population norms (Neurometrics database). Using a subset of quantitative EEG 
      (qEEG) features, forward stepwise discriminant analyses are used to construct 
      classifier functions. Along this vein, the main objective of this experiment is 
      to distinguish profiles of qEEG, which differentiate depressive from demented 
      patients (n = 125). The results showed that demented patients present deviations 
      above the control group in variables associated to slow rhythms: Normed Monopolar 
      Relative Power Theta for Cz and Normed Bipolar Relative Power Theta for Head. On 
      the other hand, the deviation below the control group occurs with the variable 
      associated to alpha rhythm: Normed Monopolar Relative Power Alpha for P3, in 
      dementia. Using this method, the present investigation demonstrated high 
      discriminant accuracy in separating Primary Degenerative Dementia from Major 
      Depressive Disorder (Depression).

TI  - Automatic removal of eye movement and blink artifacts from EEG data using blind 
      component separation.
PG  - 313-25
AB  - Signals from eye movements and blinks can be orders of magnitude larger than 
      brain-generated electrical potentials and are one of the main sources of 
      artifacts in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Rejecting contaminated trials 
      causes substantial data loss, and restricting eye movements/blinks limits the 
      experimental designs possible and may impact the cognitive processes under 
      investigation. This article presents a method based on blind source separation 
      (BSS) for automatic removal of electroocular artifacts from EEG data. BBS is a 
      signal-processing methodology that includes independent component analysis (ICA). 
      In contrast to previously explored ICA-based methods for artifact removal, this 
      method is automated. Moreover, the BSS algorithm described herein can isolate 
      correlated electroocular components with a high degree of accuracy. Although the 
      focus is on eliminating ocular artifacts in EEG data, the approach can be 
      extended to other sources of EEG contamination such as cardiac signals, 
      environmental noise, and electrode drift, and adapted for use with 
      magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, a magnetic correlate of EEG.

TI  - Noninvasive measurement of neuronal activity with near-infrared optical imaging.
PG  - 372-86
AB  - Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) alone offers the possibility of simultaneously and 
      noninvasively measuring neuronal and vascular signals in the brain with temporal 
      resolution of up to 1 ms. However, while optical measurement of hemodynamic 
      signals is well established, optical measurement of neuronal activation (the 
      so-called fast signal) is just emerging and requires further optimization and 
      validation. In this work, we present preliminary studies in which we measured the 
      fast signal in 10 healthy volunteers during finger-tapping, tactile stimulation, 
      and electrical median nerve stimulation. We used an instrument (CW4) with 8 
      source (690 and 830 nm) and 16 detector positions-more optodes than the 
      instruments in previously reported studies. This allowed us to record the 
      ipsilateral and contralateral sensorimotor cortex simultaneously, while at the 
      same time measuring the evoked hemodynamic response. We used an acquisition time 
      of 25 ms per image; after averaging approximately 1000 events, the 
      signal-to-noise ratio was approximately 10(4). Since the expected relative 
      intensity changes due to the fast signal (approximately 10(-3)) are smaller than 
      the relative intensity changes due to physiological effects (approximately 
      10(-1)), we enhanced the suppression of competing signals such as the 
      heartbeat-associated intensity changes, and established five criteria with which 
      to assess the robustness of the fast signal. We detected the fast signal in 43% 
      of the measurements during finger-tapping, 60% of those during tactile 
      stimulation, and 23% of those during electrical median nerve stimulation. The 
      relative changes in intensity associated with the fast signal were approximately 
      0.07% and the latency of the signal was approximately 100 ms.

TI  - Linear and nonlinear measures and seizure anticipation in temporal lobe epilepsy.
PG  - 335-45
AB  - In a recent paper, we showed that the value of a nonlinear quantity computed from 
      scalp electrode data was correlated with the time to a seizure in patients with 
      temporal lobe epilepsy. In this paper we study the relationship between the 
      linear and nonlinear content and analyses of the scalp data. We do this in two 
      ways. First, using surrogate data methods, we show that there is important 
      nonlinear structure in the scalp electrode data to which our methods are 
      sensitive. Second, we study the behavior of some simple linear metrics on the 
      same set of scalp data to see whether the nonlinear metrics contain additional 
      information not carried by the linear measures. We find that, while the nonlinear 
      measures are correlated with time to seizure, the linear measures are not, over 
      the time scales we have defined. The linear and nonlinear measures are themselves 
      apparently linearly correlated, but that correlation can be ascribed to the 
      influence of a small set of outliers, associated with muscle artifact. A 
      remaining, more subtle relation between the variance of the values of a nonlinear 
      measure and the expectation value of a linear measure persists. Implications of 
      our observations are discussed.

TI  - Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease:

PG  - 1036-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The subthalamic nucleus is the preferred target for deep brain 
      stimulation in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The site of permanent 
      stimulation is the subject of ongoing debate, as stimulation both within and 
      adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus may be effective. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      position of active electrode contacts in relation to the dorsal margin of the 
      subthalamic nucleus as determined by intraoperative microrecordings and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: In 25 patients suffering from severe levodopa 
      sensitive parkinsonism, deep brain stimulating electrodes (n = 49) were implanted 
      following mapping of the subthalamic nucleus by microrecording and 
      microstimulation along five parallel tracks. Postoperative stereotactic 
      radiography and fusion of pre- and postoperative MRI studies were used to 
      determine the stereotactic position relative to the midcommissural point of the 
      most effective electrode contacts selected for permanent stimulation (n = 49). 
      Intraoperative microrecordings were analysed retrospectively to define the dorsal 
      margin of the subthalamic nucleus. In cases where the dorsal margin could be 
      defined in at least three microrecording tracks (n = 37) it was correlated with 
      the position of the active contact using an algorithm developed for direct three 
      dimensional comparisons. RESULTS: Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus resulted 
      in marked improvement in levodopa sensitive parkinsonian symptoms and levodopa 
      induced dyskinesias, with significant improvement in UPDRS III scores. In several 
      instances, projection of the electrode artefacts onto the T2 weighted MRI 
      visualised subthalamic nucleus of individual patients suggested that the 
      electrodes had passed through the subthalamic nucleus. When the actual position 
      of active electrode contacts (n = 35) was correlated with the dorsal margin of 
      the subthalamic nucleus as defined neurophysiologically, most contacts were 
      located either in proximity (+/- 1.0 mm) to the dorsal border of the subthalamic 
      nucleus (32.4%) or further dorsal within the subthalamic region (37.8%). The 
      other active contacts (29.7%) were detected within the dorsal (sensorimotor) 
      subthalamic nucleus. The average position of all active contacts (n = 49) was 
      12.8 mm (+/- 1.0) lateral, 1.9 mm (+/- 1.4) posterior, and 1.6 mm (+/- 2.1) 
      ventral to the midcommissural point. CONCLUSIONS: Subthalamic nucleus stimulation 
      appears to be most effective in the border area between the upper subthalamic 
      nucleus (sensorimotor part) and the subthalamic area containing the zona incerta, 
      fields of Forel, and subthalamic nucleus projections.

TI  - Independent component analysis as a tool to eliminate artifacts in EEG: a 
      quantitative study.
PG  - 249-57
AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) is a novel technique that calculates 
      independent components from mixed signals. A hypothetical clinical application is 
      to remove artifacts in EEG. The goal of this study was to apply ICA to standard 
      EEG recordings to eliminate well-known artifacts, thus quantifying its efficacy 
      in an objective way. Eighty samples of recordings with spikes and evident 
      artifacts of electrocardiogram (EKG), eye movements, 50-Hz interference, muscle, 
      or electrode artifact were studied. ICA components were calculated using the 
      Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm. The signal 
      was reconstructed excluding those components related to the artifacts. A 
      normalized correlation coefficient was used as a measure of the changes caused by 
      the suppression of these components. ICA produced an evident clearing-up of 
      signals in all the samples. The morphology and the topography of the spike were 
      very similar before and after the removal of the artifacts. The correlation 
      coefficient showed that the rest of the signal did not change significantly. Two 
      examiners independently looked at the samples to identify the changes in the 
      morphology and location of the discharge and the artifacts. In conclusion, ICA 
      proved to be a useful tool to clean artifacts in short EEG samples, without 
      having the disadvantages associated with the digital filters. The distortion of 
      the interictal activity measured by correlation analysis was minimal.

TI  - Statistical mapping of scalp-recorded ictal EEG records using wavelet analysis.
PG  - 664-72
AB  - PURPOSE: The wavelet transform (WT) is well suited for the analysis of signals 
      whose characteristics vary rapidly over time. We devised a computerized method 
      for objective scoring of scalp-recorded seizures that takes advantage of the WT. 
      METHODS: Using wavelet coefficients as a metric, we devised a statistical scoring 
      method aimed at detecting significant and sustained rhythmic buildup. The 
      approach was used to create spatiotemporal significance maps for each seizure. 
      Each seizure was also independently analyzed by computer and an expert reader not 
      involved in the clinical workup or computer analysis of these patients. 
      Hierarchical decision rules for determining seizure lateralization and 
      localization were established from a training set of seizures and subsequently 
      tested on those from an independent test set of seizures. The test dataset 
      included a total of 57 scalp-recorded seizures from 18 patients, each with a > or 
      =12-month seizure-free surgical outcome. RESULTS: Validation was determined by 
      the site of surgical resection. Of the 57 seizure records in the test dataset, 
      the computerized approach resulted in 48 correctly lateralized seizures as 
      compared to 34 for the expert reader. Further, the computer correctly localized 
      41 seizures to the expert's 31. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented appears to 
      provide an objective basis for the intrachannel scoring of ictal EEGs with 
      minimal interference from artifacts and intermittent discharges. Although the 
      approach has so far shown a substantial improvement over expert scoring in 
      estimating the lateralization and locus of seizure onset, further testing is 
      required to fully evaluate fully its diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Optimised performance of the backward longswing on rings.
PG  - 545-52
AB  - Many elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings in 
      competition. Since points are deducted if gymnasts possess motion on completion 
      of the movement, the ability to successfully perform the longswing to a 
      stationary final handstand is of great importance. Sprigings et al. (1998) found 
      that for a longswing initiated from a still handstand the optimum performance of 
      an inelastic planar simulation model resulted in a residual swing of more than 3 
      degrees in the final handstand. For the present study, a three-dimensional 
      simulation model of a gymnast swinging on rings, incorporating lateral arm 
      movements used by gymnasts and mandatory apparatus elasticity, was used to 
      investigate the possibility of performing a backward longswing initiated and 
      completed in handstands with minimal swing. Root mean square differences between 
      the actual and simulated performances for the orientations of the gymnast and 
      rings cables, the combined cable tension and the extension of the gymnast were 
      3.2 degrees, 1.0 degrees, 270N and 0.05m respectively. The optimised simulated 
      performance initiated from a handstand with 2.1 degrees of swing and using 
      realistic changes to the gymnast's technique resulted in 0.6 degrees of residual 
      swing in the final handstand. The sensitivity of the backward longswing to 
      perturbations in the technique used for the optimised performance was determined. 
      For a final handstand with minimal residual swing (2 degrees) the changes in body 
      configuration must be timed to within 15 ms while a delay of 30 ms will result in 
      considerable residual swing (7 degrees).

TI  - MR imaging of epilepsy: state of the art at 1.5 T and potential of 3 T.
PG  - 3-20
AB  - Shortly after being introduced in the nineteen eighties, magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) became a key tool for the investigation of patients with epilepsy, 
      due to its ability to acquire high quality images. The strength of the magnetic 
      field of a scanner is measured in tesla (T). This review addresses the clinical 
      and research potential in epilepsy of MR imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T. A typical 
      clinical scanning protocol at 1.5 T for a patient with refractory epilepsy may 
      include T1- and T2-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 
      imaging, and a 3D volume acquisition sequence. A research protocol may add 
      quantification of structural imaging, such as volumetric assessment and 
      T2-relaxometry, together with functional measures, such as MR-spectroscopy, 
      functional MRI and diffusion weighted sequences. MR-spectroscopy assesses the 
      metabolites of the seizure focus and other brain areas. Functional MRI allows 
      localisation of cognitive and sensori-motor function and the ability to assess 
      the spatial relationship of these functions to the seizure focus. Whereas these 
      techniques can be performed at 1.5 T, particularly MR-spectroscopy and functional 
      MRI benefit from increased magnetic field-strength. Higher magnetic 
      field-strength is associated with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The 
      increased SNR can allow shorter imaging times for a given resolution, higher 
      resolution for a given imaging time, or combination of both. The use of higher 
      magnetic field-strengths is therefore indicated for the (fast) imaging of ill 
      subjects, for long protocols, including structural, metabolic and functional 
      imaging, and for novel applications, such as continuous EEG recording and 
      functional MRI for the detection of the seizure focus. Disadvantages of MR 
      imaging in epilepsy at a high field-strength of 3 T and above are, apart from 
      engineering and technical challenges, the greater energy deposition into tissue 
      and increased susceptibility to artefacts. So far, magnets of 3 T and above have 
      been used mainly for research applications, however the benefits of high 
      field-strength for MR spectroscopy and functional MRI, and the usefulness of 
      these techniques for the investigation of epilepsy patients are obvious 
      incentives for the use of 3 T systems in routine clinical investigations.

TI  - Combined measurement of event-related potentials (ERPs) and fMRI.
PG  - 49-53
AB  - The study investigates the possibility of combined recording event-related 
      potentials (ERPs) and functional MRI (fMRI). Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were 
      elicited by an alternating black and white checkerboard, which was presented 
      blockwise outside the static 1.5 T magnetic field and during an echo planar 
      imaging (EPI). An fMRI sequence with a time window for interleaved 
      EEG-measurement and a measurement protocol which reduces pulse artifacts and 
      vibrations was used. Thus, during an EPI sequence, it was possible to detect VEPs 
      which had the same structure and latencies as VEPs outside the magnetic field and 
      which corresponded well with the observed activated areas of the visual cortex.

TI  - Brain diffusion after single seizures.
PG  - 54-63
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) after focal status 
      epilepticus has demonstrated focal alterations of the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) in the epileptogenic zone. We hypothesized that localized 
      dynamic alterations of brain diffusion during the immediate postictal state will 
      be detectable by serial DWI and correlate with the epileptogenic zone. METHODS: 
      Nine adult patients (four men, five women) with medically intractable epilepsy 
      were prospectively examined with a total of 25 DWI scans taken 2-210 min after a 
      seizure. RESULTS: The interictal ADC was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in the 
      ictogenic hippocampus in all patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The following 
      postictal changes of the ADC were seen: (a) decreases by maximally 25-31%, which 
      were most pronounced in the epileptogenic zone (n = 2); (b) generalized ADC 
      changes after generalized seizures (n = 1) or prolonged complex partial seizures 
      (n = 2); (c) no major changes after short-lived seizures or if the time to first 
      DWI scan was >15 min or both (n = 3); and (d) widespread bilateral ADC increases 
      after a flumazenil-induced seizure (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: ADC changes seen during 
      serial postictal DWI are complex and appear to reflect origin and spread of the 
      preceding seizure. A delineation of the epileptogenic zone appears to be possible 
      only in complex-partial seizures of >60 s duration that do not secondarily 
      generalize.

TI  - Reduction of transient signal oscillations in true-FISP using a linear flip angle 
      series magnetization preparation.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - An electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered, magnetization-prepared, segmented, 3D true 
      fast imaging with steady-state precession (true-FISP) sequence with fat 
      saturation was recently proposed for coronary artery imaging. A magnetization 
      preparation scheme consisting of an alpha/2 radiofrequency (RF) pulse followed by 
      20 constant flip angle dummy RF cycles was used to reduce signal oscillations in 
      the approach to steady state. However, if large resonance offsets on the order of 
      70-100 Hz are present, significant magnetization oscillations will still occur 
      during data acquisition, which will result in image ghosting and blurring. The 
      goal of this work was to validate that a linear flip angle (LFA) series can be 
      used during magnetization preparation to reduce these image artifacts. Computer 
      simulations, phantom studies, and coronary artery imaging in healthy volunteers 
      were performed to compare this magnetization preparation scheme with that of an 
      alpha/2 pulse followed by constant flip angle dummy RF cycles. The results 
      demonstrated substantial reduction in the apparent image artifacts when using 
      linearly increasing flip angles during magnetization preparation.

TI  - Mismatch responses to randomized gradient switching noise as reflected by fMRI 
      and whole-head magnetoencephalography.
PG  - 190-5
AB  - The central auditory system of the human brain uses a variety of mechanisms to 
      analyze auditory scenes, among others, preattentive detection of sudden changes 
      in the sound environment. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography 
      (MEG) provide a measure to monitor neuronal cortical currents. The mismatch 
      negativity (MMN) or field (MMNm) reflect preattentive activation in response to 
      deviants within a sequence of homogenous auditory stimuli. Functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for a higher spatial resolution as compared to 
      the extracranial electrophysiological techniques. The image encoding gradients of 
      echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences, however, elicit an interfering background 
      noise. To circumvent this shortcoming, the present study applied multi-echo EPI 
      mimicking an auditory oddball design. The gradient trains (SOA = 800 msec, 94.5 
      dB SPL, stimulus duration = 152 msec) comprised amplitude (-9 dB) and duration 
      (76 msec) deviants in a randomized sequence. Moreover, the scanner noise was 
      recorded and applied in a whole-head MEG device to validate the properties of 
      this specific material. Robust fMRI activation patterns emerged in response to 
      the deviant gradient switching. Changes in amplitude activated the entire 
      auditory cortex, whereas the duration deviants elicited right-lateralized signal 
      increase in secondary areas. The recorded scanner noise evoked reliably 
      right-lateralized mismatch MEG responses. Source localization was in accordance 
      with activation of secondary auditory cortex. The presented paradigm provides a 
      robust and feasible tool to study the functional anatomy of early cognitive 
      auditory processing in clinical populations such as schizophrenia.

TI  - Monte Carlo simulation studies of EEG and MEG localization accuracy.
PG  - 47-62
AB  - Both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are currently 
      used to localize brain activity. The accuracy of source localization depends on 
      numerous factors, including the specific inverse approach and source model, 
      fundamental differences in EEG and MEG data, and the accuracy of the volume 
      conductor model of the head (i.e., the forward model). Using Monte Carlo 
      simulations, this study removes the effect of forward model errors and 
      theoretically compares the use of EEG alone, MEG alone, and combined EEG/MEG data 
      sets for source localization. Here, we use a linear estimation inverse approach 
      with a distributed source model and a realistic forward head model. We evaluated 
      its accuracy using the crosstalk and point spread metrics. The crosstalk metric 
      for a specified location on the cortex describes the amount of activity 
      incorrectly localized onto that location from other locations. The point spread 
      metric provides the complementary measure: for that same location, the point 
      spread describes the mis-localization of activity from that specified location to 
      other locations in the brain. We also propose and examine the utility of a "noise 
      sensitivity normalized" inverse operator. Given our particular forward and 
      inverse models, our results show that 1) surprisingly, EEG localization is more 
      accurate than MEG localization for the same number of sensors averaged over many 
      source locations and orientations; 2) as expected, combining EEG with MEG 
      produces the best accuracy for the same total number of sensors; 3) the noise 
      sensitivity normalized inverse operator improves the spatial resolution relative 
      to the standard linear estimation operator; and 4) use of an a priori fMRI 
      constraint universally reduces both crosstalk and point spread.

TI  - Independent component analysis of ictal EEG in medial temporal lobe epilepsy.
PG  - 160-4
AB  - PURPOSE: Application of independent component analysis (ICA) to interictal EEGs 
      and to event-related potentials has helped noise reduction and source 
      localization. However, ICA has not been used for the analysis of ictal EEGs in 
      partial seizures. In this study, we applied ICA to the ictal EEGs of patients 
      with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and investigated whether ictal 
      components can be separated and whether they indicate correct lateralization. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four EEGs from medial TLE patients were analyzed with the 
      extended ICA algorithm. Among the resultant 20 components in each EEG, we 
      selected components with an ictal nature and reviewed their corresponding 
      topographic maps for the lateralization. We then applied quantitative methods for 
      the verification of increased quality of the reconstructed EEGs. RESULTS: All 
      ictal EEGs were successfully decomposed into one or more ictal components and 
      nonictal components. After EEG reconstruction with exclusion of artifacts, the 
      lateralizing power of the ictal EEG was increased from 75 to 96%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      ICA can separate successfully the manifold components of ictal rhythms and can 
      improve EEG quality.

TI  - Artifact robustness, inter- and intraindividual baseline stability, and rational 
      EEG parameter selection.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artifact robustness (i.e., size of deviation of an 
      electroencephalographic parameter value from baseline caused by artifacts) and 
      baseline stability (i.e., consistency of median baseline values) of 
      electroencephalographic parameters profoundly influence 
      electroencephalography-based pharmacodynamic parameter estimation and the 
      usefulness of the processed electroencephalogram as measure of the arousal state 
      of the central nervous system (depth of anesthesia). In this study, the authors 
      compared the artifact robustness and the interindividual and intraindividual 
      baseline stability of several univariate descriptors of the electroencephalogram 
      (Shannon entropy, approximate entropy, spectral edge frequency 95, delta ratio, 
      and canonical univariate parameter). METHODS: Electroencephalographic data of 16 
      healthy volunteers before and after administration of an intravenous bolus of 
      propofol (2 mg/kg body weight) were analyzed. Each volunteer was studied twice. 
      The baseline electroencephalogram was recorded for a median of 18 min before drug 
      administration. For each electroencephalographic descriptor, the authors 
      calculated the following: (1) baseline variability (= (median baseline - median 
      effect) [i.e., signal]/SD baseline [i.e., noise]) without artifact rejection; (2) 
      baseline variability with artifact rejection; and (3) baseline stability within 
      and between individuals (= (median baseline - median effect) averaged over all 
      volunteers/SD of all median baselines). RESULTS: Without artifact rejection, 
      Shannon entropy and canonical univariate parameter displayed the highest 
      signal-to-noise ratio. After artifact rejection, approximate entropy, Shannon 
      entropy, and the canonical univariate parameter displayed the highest 
      signal-to-noise ratio. Baseline stability within and between individuals was 
      highest for approximate entropy. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to robustness against 
      artifacts, the electroencephalographic entropy parameters and the canonical 
      univariate parameter were superior to spectral edge frequency 95 and delta ratio. 
      Electroencephalographic approximate entropy displayed the best interindividual 
      and intraindividual baseline stability.

TI  - Analysis and visualization of single-trial event-related potentials.
PG  - 166-85
AB  - In this study, a linear decomposition technique, independent component analysis 
      (ICA), is applied to single-trial multichannel EEG data from event-related 
      potential (ERP) experiments. Spatial filters derived by ICA blindly separate the 
      input data into a sum of temporally independent and spatially fixed components 
      arising from distinct or overlapping brain or extra-brain sources. Both the data 
      and their decomposition are displayed using a new visualization tool, the "ERP 
      image," that can clearly characterize single-trial variations in the amplitudes 
      and latencies of evoked responses, particularly when sorted by a relevant 
      behavioral or physiological variable. These tools were used to analyze data from 
      a visual selective attention experiment on 28 control subjects plus 22 
      neurological patients whose EEG records were heavily contaminated with blink and 
      other eye-movement artifacts. Results show that ICA can separate artifactual, 
      stimulus-locked, response-locked, and non-event-related background EEG activities 
      into separate components, a taxonomy not obtained from conventional signal 
      averaging approaches. This method allows: (1) removal of pervasive artifacts of 
      all types from single-trial EEG records, (2) identification and segregation of 
      stimulus- and response-locked EEG components, (3) examination of differences in 
      single-trial responses, and (4) separation of temporally distinct but spatially 
      overlapping EEG oscillatory activities with distinct relationships to task 
      events. The proposed methods also allow the interaction between ERPs and the 
      ongoing EEG to be investigated directly. We studied the between-subject component 
      stability of ICA decomposition of single-trial EEG epochs by clustering 
      components with similar scalp maps and activation power spectra. Components 
      accounting for blinks, eye movements, temporal muscle activity, event-related 
      potentials, and event-modulated alpha activities were largely replicated across 
      subjects. Applying ICA and ERP image visualization to the analysis of sets of 
      single trials from event-related EEG (or MEG) experiments can increase the 
      information available from ERP (or ERF) data.

TI  - Imaging Brain Dynamics Using Independent Component Analysis.
PG  - 1107-1122
AB  - The analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) 
      recordings is important both for basic brain research and for medical diagnosis 
      and treatment. Independent component analysis (ICA) is an effective method for 
      removing artifacts and separating sources of the brain signals from these 
      recordings. A similar approach is proving useful for analyzing functional 
      magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) data. In this paper, we outline the 
      assumptions underlying ICA and demonstrate its application to a variety of 
      electrical and hemodynamic recordings from the human brain.

TI  - Perfusion-weighted imaging of interictal hypoperfusion in temporal lobe epilepsy 
      using FAIR-HASTE: comparison with H(2)(15)O PET measurements.
PG  - 431-5
AB  - To detect perfusion abnormalities in areas of high magnetic susceptibility in the 
      brain, an arterial spin-labeling MRI technique utilizing flow-sensitive 
      alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) and half-Fourier single shot turbo 
      spin-echo (HASTE) for spin preparation and image acquisition, respectively, was 
      developed. It was initially tested in a functional study involving visual 
      stimulation, and was able to detect significant activation with an increase 
      (approximately 70%) in relative cerebral blood flow. Subsequently, it was applied 
      in a clinical situation in eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The 
      perfusion-weighted images obtained showed no susceptibility artifacts even in the 
      region of the inferior temporal lobe and were able to detect interictal 
      hypoperfusion in TLE. The results were compared with those derived from H(2)(15)O 
      PET perfusion imaging in each patient. A statistically significant correlation (r 
      = 0.75, P < 0.05) was found between results acquired from these two modalities.

TI  - Low-resolution electrical tomography of the brain during psychometrically matched 
      verbal and spatial cognitive tasks.
PG  - 144-56
AB  - EEGs were recorded from 75 normal, young, female subjects during psychometrically 
      matched verbal (WF) and spatial (DL) cognitive tasks to elicit the differences in 
      the electrical source distribution inside the brain. Recordings were obtained 
      using 43 EEG and 3 guard electrodes then visually edited and spatially filtered 
      to remove extracerebral artifacts. Twenty 1-sec artifact-free epochs were 
      obtained and analyzed from 42 and 60 subjects during WF and DL respectively. Of 
      these subjects, 20 were placed in a training set and the remainder into a test 
      set. The baseline for the comparison of the two tasks was established by 
      factoring the average cross-spectral matrices of the training-set EEGs, computed 
      in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands into spatial patterns common to the 
      two tasks. Only those spatial patterns that contributed to the correct 
      classification of subjects in the test set were included in the source analysis. 
      The source-current density distributions were obtained using the LORETA-KEY 
      algorithm. The results show that the source-current density distribution is 
      related to the putative functional activity in the brain in all three frequency 
      bands. The electrical effects of the tasks are both most highly localized and 
      lateralized in the theta band. The effects in the alpha and beta bands are much 
      more generalized and are strongly lateralized only during one and the other of 
      the tasks respectively. The conclusion is that WF is mainly a left central and 
      bilateral frontal cerebral process while DL is mainly a right central and 
      bilateral posterior cerebral process.

TI  - Electroencephalography during functional echo-planar imaging: detection of 
      epileptic spikes using post-processing methods.
PG  - 791-8
AB  - EEG has been used to trigger functional MRI of patients with focal epilepsy, but 
      EEG can be obscured by artifacts during MR data acquisition, and no continuous 
      correlation of EEG and MRI has been possible without limiting the image time. 
      Artifacts caused by an MRI sequence were investigated in five healthy subjects, 
      and an EEG of five patients with epileptic discharges was recorded during 
      echo-planar imaging. All interfering frequencies in the EEG were discrete and 
      defined by loop structures in the MRI sequence. In post-processing of the EEG 
      interfering frequencies were automatically detected by comparing the frequency 
      spectra of the EEG recorded before and during imaging. After elimination of 
      interfering frequencies by filters in the time domain or by Fourier transform, 
      reliable spike detection in the EEG recorded during MR data acquisition became 
      feasible, without loss of EEG quality.

TI  - Myogenic and scalp signals evoked by midinspiratory airway occlusion.
PG  - 422-9
AB  - A somatosensory potential that is evoked by transient added inspiratory load has 
      previously been described (Davenport PW, Friedman WA, Thompson FJ, and Franzen O. 
      J Appl Physiol 60: 1843-1848, 1986). This evoked potential is novel because it 
      arises in response to a stimulus that also evokes a muscle response, and so this 
      potential could contain myogenic components. The present study was undertaken to 
      define the relationship between the scalp response and other physiological 
      responses that are evoked by airway occlusion. Evoked signals were recorded from 
      the scalp, scalenus anterior, masseter, and electrooculogram. Responses to a 
      200-ms midinspiratory occlusion were recorded in 12 healthy volunteers. Evoked 
      responses were reliably recorded at C(3)-C(Z) and C(4)-C(Z) and from the skin 
      overlying the scalenus anterior in 11 of these subjects. The onset latencies were 
      15.7 +/- 3.1 at C(3)-C(Z), 15.9 +/- 2.1 at C(4)-C(Z), and 17.6 +/- 5.5 ms at 
      scalenus anterior. In nine subjects, the masseter response appeared to coincide 
      with the mouth pressure trace, and this was interpreted as movement artifact. No 
      consistent electrooculogram or frontal electroencephalogram response was 
      recorded. Because of the similarity in onset latency at C(3)-C(Z), C(4)-C(Z), and 
      scalenus anterior, it was concluded that the myogenic signal may contribute to 
      the scalp response and should be viewed as a potential source of artifact in 
      experiments of this nature.

TI  - Automatic detection of rapid eye movements by discrete wavelet transform.
PG  - 276-7
AB  - In order to detect rapid eye movements (REM) automatically, the Discrete Wavelet 
      Transform was applied to each 8-s segment of electrooculogram (EOG) data for 30 
      min of 8 h of normal sleep. The Haar function was used as an analysing wavelet 
      because this function is similar to the REM waveform. By shifting the phase of 
      the analysing wavelet by pi/4 of the function, 96% of REM could be detected. The 
      artifacts caused by body movements could be detected simultaneously by this 
      method. Computing time required for the detection of REM was only 11 s for 30 min 
      EOG data.

TI  - Membrane destabilization assay based on potassium release from liposomes.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Inorganic ions are highly suitable markers for monitoring release of the inner 
      content of liposomes. In the present study, a potassium (K(+)) selective 
      electrode was used to evaluate the rate of K(+) release from large unilamellar 
      vesicles (LUV). The developed method is highly sensitive, reproducible and 
      inexpensive. Since the K(+) ion is smaller than other markers conventionally 
      used, the method described is more sensitive than one of the standard methods 
      that uses ANTS/DPX. In addition, the method allows us to expand the set of 
      molecules used as inner content markers to a lower size range. The experimental 
      protocol we described contains improvements on the method of Breukink et al. 
      (Biochemistry, 36 (1997) 6968). Our developed method was applied to compare the 
      destabilizing activities of two amphipathic peptides of natural origin (Melittin 
      and HIV env seg I, 827-851) and of two artificial peptides (Hels 7:11 and 9:9) 
      synthesized de novo by Kiyota et al. (Biochemistry, 35 (1996) 13196). The tested 
      peptides released 20% of the liposomal K(+) in 1 min at peptide-to-lipid ratio of 
      a few mmol per mol of total lipids (LUV sized to 0.2 micrometer, molar 
      composition is POPC:POPS:Chol 2:2:1).

TI  - Enhancement of deep epileptiform activity in the EEG via 3-D adaptive spatial 
      filtering.
PG  - 707-16
AB  - The detection of epileptiform discharges (ED's) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. However, when the 
      epileptogenic source is located deep in the brain, the ED's at the scalp are 
      often masked by more superficial, higher-amplitude EEG activity. A noninvasive 
      technique which uses an adaptive "beamformer" spatial filter has been 
      investigated for the enhancement of signals from deep sources in the brain 
      suspected of containing ED's. A forward three-layer spherical model was used to 
      relate a dipolar source to recorded signals to determine the beamformer's spatial 
      response constraints. The beamformer adapts, using the least-mean-squares (LMS) 
      algorithm, to reduce signals from sources distant to some arbitrarily defined 
      location in the brain. The beamformer produces three outputs, being the 
      orthogonal components of the signal estimated to have arisen at or near the 
      assumed location. Simulations were performed by using the same forward model to 
      superimpose realistic ED's on normal EEG recordings. The simulations show the 
      beamformer's ability to enhance signals emanating from deep foci by way of an 
      enhancement ratio (ER), being the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to 
      that observed at any of the scalp electrodes. The performance of the beamformer 
      has been evaluated for 1) the number of scalp electrodes, 2) the recording 
      montage, 3) dependence on the background EEG, 4) dependence on magnitude, depth, 
      and orientation of epileptogenic focus, and 5) sensitivity to inaccuracies in the 
      estimated location of the focus. Results from the simulations show the 
      beamformer's performance to be dependent on the number of electrodes and 
      moderately sensitive to variations in the EEG background. Conversely, its 
      performance appears to be largely independent of the amplitude and morphology of 
      the ED. The dependence studies indicated that the beamformer's performance was 
      moderately dependent on eccentricity with the ER increasing as the dipolar source 
      and the beamformer were moved from the center to the surface of the brain 
      (1.51-2.26 for radial dipoles and 1.17-2.69 for tangential dipoles). The 
      beamformer was also moderately dependent on variations in polar or azimuthal 
      angle for radial and tangential dipoles. Higher ER's tended to be seen for 
      locations between electrode sites. The beamformer was more sensitive to 
      inaccuracies in both polar and azimuthal location than depth of the dipolar 
      source. For polar locations, an ER > 1.0 was achieved when the beamformer was 
      located within +/- 25 degrees of a radial dipole and +/- 35 degrees of a 
      tangential dipole. Similarly, angular ranges of +/- 37.5 degrees and +/- 45 
      degrees, respectively, for inaccuracies in azimuthal locations. Preliminary 
      results from real EEG records, comprising 12 definite or questionable 
      epileptiform events, from four patients, demonstrated the beamformer's ability to 
      enhance these events by a mean 100% (52%-215%) for referential data and a mean 
      104% (50%-145%) for bipolar data.

TI  - Video-EEG and ictal SPECT in three patients with both epileptic and non-epileptic 
      seizures.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - We report scalp EEG and ictal SPECT findings in epileptic (complex partial) and 
      non-epileptic seizures in three patients who experienced both types of event 
      during presurgical investigation of medically intractable epilepsies. In all 
      three patients, ictal SPECT showed localizing changes in cerebral blood flow 
      during epileptic seizures, but showed no change during pseudoseizures. In two 
      patients, the physical manifestations of the pseudoseizures were similar to those 
      of the epileptic seizures, supporting the contention that physiological 
      activation is unlikely to mimic ictal perfusion changes. In one patient, the EEG 
      recording was rendered difficult to interpret by muscle artefact, while SPECT was 
      clear and showed no change. SPECT is not a primary tool for diagnosis of 
      pseudoseizures, but when patients undergoing presurgical investigation are 
      injected during pseudoseizures, then SPECT is unlikely to show misleading 
      perfusion changes due to activation effects, and may aid diagnosis where there is 
      muscle artefact on EEG.

TI  - Mechanisms of epithelial cell-cell adhesion and cell compaction revealed by 
      high-resolution tracking of E-cadherin-green fluorescent protein.
PG  - 1105-19
AB  - Cadherin-mediated adhesion initiates cell reorganization into tissues, but the 
      mechanisms and dynamics of such adhesion are poorly understood. Using time-lapse 
      imaging and photobleach recovery analyses of a fully functional E-cadherin/GFP 
      fusion protein, we define three sequential stages in cell-cell adhesion and 
      provide evidence for mechanisms involving E-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton 
      in transitions between these stages. In the first stage, membrane contacts 
      between two cells initiate coalescence of a highly mobile, diffuse pool of cell 
      surface E-cadherin into immobile punctate aggregates along contacting membranes. 
      These E-cadherin aggregates are spatially coincident with membrane attachment 
      sites for actin filaments branching off from circumferential actin cables that 
      circumscribe each cell. In the second stage, circumferential actin cables near 
      cell-cell contact sites separate, and the resulting two ends of the cable swing 
      outwards to the perimeter of the contact. Concomitantly, subsets of E-cadherin 
      puncta are also swept to the margins of the contact where they coalesce into 
      large E-cadherin plaques. This reorganization results in the formation of a 
      circumferential actin cable that circumscribes both cells, and is embedded into 
      each E-cadherin plaque at the contact margin. At this stage, the two cells 
      achieve maximum contact, a process referred to as compaction. These changes in 
      E-cadherin and actin distributions are repeated when additional single cells 
      adhere to large groups of cells. The third stage of adhesion occurs as additional 
      cells are added to groups of >3 cells; circumferential actin cables linked to 
      E-cadherin plaques on adjacent cells appear to constrict in a purse-string 
      action, resulting in the further coalescence of individual plaques into the 
      vertices of multicell contacts. The reorganization of E-cadherin and actin 
      results in the condensation of cells into colonies. We propose a model to explain 
      how, through strengthening and compaction, E-cadherin and actin cables coordinate 
      to remodel initial cell-cell contacts to the final condensation of cells into 
      colonies.

TI  - Subdural grid implantation for intracranial EEG recording: CT and MR appearance.
PG  - 1089-93
AB  - PURPOSE: Subdural grid arrays are used when seizure activity cannot be located by 
      ictal scalp recordings and when functional cortical mapping is required before 
      surgery. This study was performed to determine and compare the CT and MR imaging 
      appearance of subdural EEG grids and to identify the types and frequency of 
      associated complications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical 
      records and imaging studies of 51 consecutive patients who underwent 54 
      craniotomies for subdural EEG grid implantation with either stainless steel or 
      platinum alloy contacts between June 1988 and September 1993. Twenty-two patients 
      had both CT and MR examinations, 27 patients had CT only, and five patients had 
      MR imaging only. All studies were assessed for image quality and degradation by 
      the implanted EEG grids, for intra- and extraaxial collections, and for mass 
      effect, with differences of opinion resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Subdural EEG 
      grids caused extensive streak artifacts on all CT scans (corresponding directly 
      to grid composition) and mild to moderate magnetic susceptibility artifacts on MR 
      images. Sixteen associated complications were detected among the 54 patients 
      imaged, including four significant extraaxial hematomas, four subfalcine or 
      transtentorial herniations, two tension pneumocephali, two extraaxial CSF 
      collections, two intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and one case each of cerebritis 
      and brain abscess. In all but four cases, the detected complications were not 
      clinically apparent and did not require specific treatment. There were no 
      residual sequelae. CONCLUSION: Because of extensive streak artifacts, CT showed 
      only gross complications, such as herniation and grid displacement by extraaxial 
      collections. MR imaging artifacts were more localized, allowing superior 
      evaluation of subdural EEG grid placement and associated complications.

TI  - The EEG findings in extratemporal seizures.
PG  - S1-8
AB  - Extratemporal seizures originate from the frontal, central, parietal, occipital, 
      and midline regions of the brain. The scalp EEG can show various types of 
      interictal and ictal discharges consisting of spikes, spike and wave sharp waves, 
      paroxysmal fast activity, or rhythmic activity in the beta, alpha, theta, or 
      delta frequency ranges. The discharges can occur as focal, regional, lateralized, 
      or secondarily generalized discharges. Discharges arising from the frontal region 
      are varied and at times complex. Centro-temporal spikes associated with benign 
      epilepsy of childhood have a characteristic blunt spike and wave appearance. 
      Centro-parietal spikes can occur in children with benign childhood epilepsy or in 
      association with symptomatic epilepsies at any age. Occipital spike discharges 
      have been seen in young children with visual problems, benign occipital epilepsy 
      of childhood, the Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other symptomatic or structural 
      lesions involving the occipital lobe. There may be problems with detection of the 
      source of origin of seizures secondary to the anatomy of the various regions, 
      deep foci, small restricted foci, rapid spread of epileptiform discharges, and 
      contaminating effects of muscle and movement artifact. Depth or intracranial 
      recordings may help in further localization of foci.

TI  - Consistent EEG focalities detected in subjects with primary generalized 
      epilepsies monitored for two decades.
PG  - 797-812
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the evolution of interictal findings in serial EEGs from 
      patients with primary generalized epilepsy. METHODS: A cohort of 89 subjects with 
      various primary generalized epilepsies were reviewed. Thirty-one did not meet a 
      priori criteria. Of the 58 patients analyzed, 12 had only absence seizures, 28 
      had absence seizures followed by one or more generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 9 
      had generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by absence and/or myoclonic 
      seizures. and 9 had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Patients were followed for a 
      mean of 16 years. An average of 39 EEGs were obtained on each patient. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-two patients (56%) had focal features present in up to 65% of the EEGs in 
      each of the patients. Accepted focalities were only those that were consistent in 
      lateralization, location and, often, morphology across the span of the study. 
      Focal findings were most often temporal or frontal. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      typical primary generalized epilepsies show a high incidence of focal EEG 
      features that cannot be explained on the basis of structural lesions, 
      coincidental factors, or to artifacts of the selection criteria. Although the 
      data do not allow a definitive explanation, possible mechanisms include 
      associated focal cortical pathology such as microdysgenesis, and development over 
      time of localized, self-sustaining hyperexcitability in low-threshold cortical 
      structures subjected to repeated generalized spike-wave activity. Either 
      hypothesis implies the participation and interaction of genetic, ontogenic, and 
      environmental factors.

TI  - Functional anatomic studies of memory retrieval for auditory words and visual 
      pictures.
PG  - 6219-35
AB  - Functional neuroimaging with positron emission tomography was used to study brain 
      areas activated during memory retrieval. Subjects (n = 15) recalled items from a 
      recent study episode (episodic memory) during two paired-associate recall tasks. 
      The tasks differed in that PICTURE RECALL required pictorial retrieval, whereas 
      AUDITORY WORD RECALL required word retrieval. Word REPETITION and REST served as 
      two reference tasks. Comparing recall with repetition revealed the following 
      observations. (1) Right anterior prefrontal activation (similar to that seen in 
      several previous experiments), in addition to bilateral frontal-opercular and 
      anterior cingulate activations. (2) An anterior subdivision of medial frontal 
      cortex [pre-supplementary motor area (SMA)] was activated, which could be 
      dissociated from a more posterior area (SMA proper). (3) Parietal areas were 
      activated, including a posterior medial area near precuneus, that could be 
      dissociated from an anterior parietal area that was deactivated. (4) Multiple 
      medial and lateral cerebellar areas were activated. Comparing recall with rest 
      revealed similar activations, except right prefrontal activation was minimal and 
      activations related to motor and auditory demands became apparent (e.g., 
      bilateral motor and temporal cortex). Directly comparing picture recall with 
      auditory word recall revealed few notable activations. Taken together, these 
      findings suggest a pathway that is commonly used during the episodic retrieval of 
      picture and word stimuli under these conditions. Many areas in this pathway 
      overlap with areas previously activated by a different set of retrieval tasks 
      using stem-cued recall, demonstrating their generality. Examination of 
      activations within individual subjects in relation to structural magnetic 
      resonance images provided an-atomic information about the location of these 
      activations. Such data, when combined with the dissociations between functional 
      areas, provide an increasingly detailed picture of the brain pathways involved in 
      episodic retrieval tasks.

TI  - Muscle artifacts in the sleep EEG: automated detection and effect on all-night 
      EEG power spectra.
PG  - 155-64
AB  - Owing to the use of scalp electrodes in human sleep recordings, cortical EEG 
      signals are inevitably intermingled with the electrical activity of the muscle 
      tissue on the skull. Muscle artifacts are characterized by surges in high 
      frequency activity and are readily identified because of their outlying high 
      values relative to the local background activity. To detect bursts of myogenic 
      activity a simple algorithm is introduced that compares high frequency activity 
      (26.25-32.0 Hz) in each 4-s epoch with the activity level in a local 3-min 
      window. A 4-s value was considered artifactual if it exceeded the local 
      background activity by a certain factor. Sensitivity and specificity of the 
      artifact detection algorithm were empirically adjusted by applying different 
      factors as artifact thresholds. In an analysis of sleep EEG signals recorded from 
      25 healthy young adults 2.3% (SEM: 0.16) of all 4-s epochs during sleep were 
      identified as artifacts when a threshold factor of four was applied. 
      Contamination of the EEG by muscle activity was more frequent towards the end of 
      non-REM sleep episodes when EEG slow wave activity declined. Within and across 
      REM sleep episodes muscle artifacts were evenly distributed. When the EEG signal 
      was cleared of muscle artifacts, the all-night EEG power spectrum showed 
      significant reductions in power density for all frequencies from 0.25-32.0 Hz. 
      Between 15 and 32 Hz, muscle artifacts made up a substantial part (20-70%) of 
      all-night EEG power density. It is concluded that elimination of short-lasting 
      muscle artifacts reduces the confound between cortical and myogenic activity and 
      is important in interpreting quantitative EEG data. Quantitative approaches in 
      defining and detecting transient events in the EEG signal may help to determine 
      which EEG phenomena constitute clinically significant arousals.

TI  - Automatic analysis of sleep spindles--assessment in one case treated with a 
      benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug.
PG  - 107-13
AB  - Wave-form analysis and detection of sleep spindles should be automatically 
      performed to achieve objective and highly precise determination of the pattern of 
      appearance of sleep spindles. The conditions for constructing the automatic 
      analysis and detection are as follows: 1) it is recommended that EEGs be sampled 
      at 500 Hz or higher intervals; 2) the digital filter with the threshold that is 
      most appropriate for removal of artifacts should be used; 3) various conditions 
      for the analysis and detection of wave-forms are widely used; and 4) a procedure 
      for inspecting and reading record paper should also be included in the set-up. 
      Taking these points into consideration, the authors developed an automatic 
      analysis system for sleep spindles, which employs a computer. The system was 
      applied to a case preliminarily treated with a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, 
      ethyl loflazepate (CM6912). The assessment using this system revealed that the 
      CM6912 administration induced an increase in sleep spindles, delayed frequency, 
      and caused amplitude increases and a prolonged duration.

TI  - Seizures during opioid anesthetic induction--are they opioid-induced rigidity?
PG  - 852-62
AB  - The tape recorded EEGs of 127 patients anesthetized with large doses of opioids 
      were retrospectively analyzed for evidence of opioid-induced seizures, and in 
      particular, correlated with movements that occurred during induction and could be 
      clinically interpreted as seizures. Bilateral EEG leads in patients receiving 
      fentanyl (20), sufentanil (20), or alfentanil (87) were recorded. Forty-six of 
      these patients from all opioid groups manifested intense rigidity, as assessed 
      both clinically and by EMGs recorded from eight muscles in 69 of the patients 
      receiving alfentanil. This intense rigidity often resembled seizures, in that the 
      phenomenon entailed severe stiffness of both limbs and trunk, with an explosive 
      onset of myoclonic limb movements, and associated vertical nystagmus. 
      Electroencephalographic observations were extensive, entailing 69 h of paper 
      recordings played back from the tapes, at paper speeds of 30 or 60 mm/s, with 
      detailed annotations from the voice track. These paper recordings were examined 
      in detail independently by three of the investigators, who were unaware of the 
      clinical phenomena that had occurred. The only observed EEG activity that could 
      have been interpreted as epileptiform consisted of small sharp waves related to 
      muscle activity or other artifact. The EEG never indicated seizure activity 
      during these drug-induced movements and rigidity. Reports of opioid-induced 
      seizures are reviewed and a set of criteria is offered to help achieve future 
      consistency and credibility in evaluating this phenomenon. The available evidence 
      does not support the existence of opioid-induced seizures in the clinical 
      setting.

TI  - The dependence of impulse propagation speed on firing frequency, dispersion, for 
      the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
PG  - 227-59
AB  - Propagation speed of an impulse is influenced by previous activity. A pulse 
      following its predecessor too closely may travel more slowly than a solitary 
      pulse. In contrast, for some range of interspike intervals, a pulse may travel 
      faster than normal because of a possible superexcitable phase of its 
      predecessor's wake. Thus, in general, pulse speeds and interspike intervals will 
      not remain constant during propagation. We consider these issues for the 
      Hodgkin-Huxley cable equations. First, the relation between speed and frequency 
      or interspike interval, the dispersion relation, is computed for particular 
      solutions, steadily propagating periodic wave trains. For each frequency, omega, 
      below some maximum frequency, omega max, we find two such solutions, one fast and 
      one slow. The latter are likely unstable as a computational example illustrates. 
      The solitary pulse is obtained in the limit as omega tends to zero. At high 
      frequency, speed drops significantly below the solitary pulse speed; for 6.3 
      degrees C, the drop at omega max is greater than 60%. For an intermediate range 
      of frequencies, supernormal speeds are found and these are correlated with 
      oscillatory swings in sub- and superexcitability in the return to rest of an 
      impulse. Qualitative consequences of the dispersion relation are illustrated with 
      several different computed pulse train responses of the full cable equations for 
      repetitively applied current pulses. Moreover, changes in pulse speed and 
      interspike interval during propagation are predicted quantitatively by a simple 
      kinematic approximation which applies the dispersion relation, instantaneously, 
      to individual pulses. One example shows how interspike time intervals can be 
      distorted during propagation from a ratio of 2:1 at input to 6:5 at a distance of 
      6.5 cm.

TI  - Ambulatory ST segment monitoring. Problems, pitfalls, solutions, and clinical 
      application.
PG  - 419-25
AB  - The introduction of frequency modulated recording systems for ambulatory 
      electrocardiographic monitoring (Oxford Medilog mark 2 and Cardiodyne cassette 
      recorders) prompted comparison with a conventional direct recording type of 
      recorder (Oxford Medilog mark 1). The recordings obtained by the frequency 
      modulated recorders were very much superior to those obtained by the direct 
      recording type of recorder. The direct recording suffered from poor low frequency 
      response, phase shift, and cable motions artefacts. Correction of these problems 
      with careful attention to electrode application enabled stable graphs to be 
      obtained over 24 hours. The clinical applications were explored by comparing the 
      results of exercie tests with a computer assisted system with frequency modulated 
      ambulatory monitoring in 30 patients. A range of ST deviations from pure ST 
      depressions throughout 24 hours, pure ST elevation, and a combination of ST 
      elevation and depression were seen, suggesting a spectrum of changes hitherto 
      unsuspected in these patients. Painless ST changes were approximately twice as 
      common as those associated with pain. These findings indicate a valuable role for 
      ST segment monitoring in ischaemic heart disease, particularly with the 
      availability of high fidelity modulated tracings which do not distort ST 
      segments.

TI  - Self-induction of epileptic seizures by eyeclosure: incidence and recognition.
PG  - 386-9
AB  - Self-induction of epileptic seizures is generally regarded as a rarity, chiefly 
      observed in patients of subnormal intelligence. During EEG recordings with open 
      eyes in a consecutive series of 48 photosensitive patients, however, 13 subjects 
      induced paroxysmal activity of seizures by eyeclosure with forced upward 
      deviation of the eyes. Eyeclosure on command produced a different type of 
      oculographic artefact and induced paroxysmal activity in only one subject. Two 
      patients were of subnormal intelligence but all displayed psychiatric or 
      psychosocial problems. The incidence of induced paroxysmal activity was reduced 
      by reduction of ambient lighting. Eight patients admitted self-induction of 
      seizures. We conclude that this phenomenon occurs more often than was previously 
      supposed and can be recongnized by the recording in photosensitive patients of 
      prolonged EEGs with eyes open and in a brightly lit environment.

TI  - Automatic detection and operant reinforcement of slow potential shifts.
PG  - 411-3
AB  - A technique for the automatic detection and operant reinforcement of slow 
      potential (SP) changes is described. The SP shift detection device contains 3 
      inhibit channels to control sources of potential artifact including: vertical 
      EOG, horizontal EOG and high voltage EEG transients. Two EEG SP shift detection 
      circuits allow the simultaneous analysis of positive and negative shifts. The 
      operation and potential uses of the device are discussed.

TI  - Response of semicircular canal dependent units in vestibular nuclei to rotation 
      of a linear acceleration vector without angular acceleration.
PG  - 475-94
AB  - 1. Recent experiments have shown that rotation of a linear acceleration vector 
      round the head can generate involuntary ocular nystagmus in the absence of 
      angular acceleration. The present experiments examine the suggestion that 
      adequate stimulation of the semicircular canals may contribute to this 
      response.2. Decerebrate cats were located in a stereotaxic device on a platform, 
      slung from four parallel cables, which could be driven smoothly round a circular 
      orbit without inducing significant angular movement of the platform. This 
      Parallel Swing Rotation (PSR) generated a centripetal acceleration of 4.4 
      m/sec(2) which rotated round the head at 0.52 rev/sec.3. The discharge frequency 
      of specifically lateral canal-dependent neural units in the vestibular nuclei of 
      cats was recorded during PSR to right and left, and in the absence of motion. The 
      dynamic responses to purely angular motion were also examined on a servo-driven 
      turntable.4. Without exception all proven canal-dependent cells examined 
      (twenty-nine cells in nine cats) were more active during PSR in the direction of 
      endolymph circulation assessed to be excitatory to the unit, than during PSR in 
      the opposite direction.5. The observed changes in discharge frequency are 
      assessed to have been of a magnitude appropriate for the generation of the 
      involuntary oculomotor response induced by the same stimulus in the intact 
      animal.6. The findings suggest that a linear acceleration vector which rotates in 
      the plane of the lateral semicircular canals can be an adequate stimulus to 
      ampullary receptors, though an explanation which invokes the modulation of canal 
      cells by a signal dependent upon the sequential activation of macular receptors 
      cannot be positively excluded.

TI  - The effect of (+)-tubocurarine chloride and of acute hypotension on 
      electrocortical activity of the cat.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - 1. The effects of I.V. injection of tubocurarine (3 mg/kg) and of acute 
      hypotension upon electrocortical activity of cats under sodium pentobarbitone 
      were analysed. Technical artifacts associated with changes in brain volume were 
      minimized.2. Initially, the superficial cortical response was reduced by 
      tubocurarine either insignificantly or by 34% or less. Cats bled before injection 
      of tubocurarine showed initially a similar reduction but, occasionally, a severe 
      delayed reduction was found. Any fall in the superficial cortical response 
      started during the secondary rise in B.P., many seconds after the B.P. had 
      reached its lowest initial level. By contrast, spontaneous electrocortical 
      activity was reduced approximately when the peak initial fall of B.P. occurred 
      and it started to recover during the secondary rise in B.P. Reduction of the 
      superficial cortical response could still be elicited after spindling had been 
      suppressed by deep barbiturate anaesthesia. The initial thalamocortical afferent 
      component in somatosensory area I, which was evoked by dorsal column stimulation, 
      was less reduced by injection of tubocurarine than were the post-synaptic 
      positive-negative components.3. The depressant effects of injected tubocurarine 
      upon the superficial cortical response and spindle activity were approximated by 
      rapid arterial bleeding.4. The superficial cortical response was reduced 
      following virtual arrest of the cerebral circulation by acute exsanguination or 
      by acute oil embolization. Such reduction most likely does not depend on systemic 
      transport of inhibitory substances to the brain.5. After injection of 
      tubocurarine the rate of outflow from the superior sagittal sinus was variably 
      reduced during the initial fall in B.P., and often showed a variable, secondary 
      increase. A net deficit in cerebral blood flow was usually present during the 
      period of 80 sec after injection.6. The variability in the effects of injected 
      tubocurarine upon electrocortical activity is attributed to the variability of 
      the net deficit in cerebral blood flow.
